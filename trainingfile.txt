[Canon PowerShot SD500]	SD500[+2]	We really enjoyed shooting with the Canon PowerShot SD500. [Canon PowerShot SD500]	design[+2]	It has an exterior design that combines form and function more elegantly than any point-and-shoot we've ever tested. [Canon PowerShot SD500]	image-processing system[+1]	A Digic II-powered image-processing system enables the SD500 to snap a limitless stream of 7-megapixel photos at a respectable clip, its start-up time is tops in its class, and it delivers decent photos when compared to its competition. [Canon PowerShot SD500]	image[+2]	The SD500 rivals the Canon G6 in image quality. [Canon PowerShot SD500]	pricey[-1]	I thought given all the "10" reviews about this camera that I would buy it in spite of being a bit pricey. [Canon PowerShot SD500]	LCD[-1]	I did see the review here and other places about a cracked LCD screen. [Canon PowerShot SD500]	LCD[-1]	When I went to put in the new SD Card I looked at the LCD Screen -- CRACKED-- and the fluid gave a Jackson Pollock type appearance to the screen, black and blue and purple blotches and streaks --useless. [Canon PowerShot SD500]	camera[+3]	This camera is truely superb.[Canon PowerShot SD500]	pictures[+2]	The startup time, quality of pictures and videos is outstanding.[Canon PowerShot SD500]	manual control[-1]	Some more manual control would have been nice. [Canon PowerShot SD500]	pictures[+3]	They say that they are the best pictures they have ever see from a compact. [Canon PowerShot SD500]	Canon[+2]	 I went out and got the Canon today. [Canon PowerShot SD500]	picture[+3]	I've taken about hundred shot with the Canon, in varying lighting situations, all in auto mode, and not one blurry picture!!! [Canon PowerShot SD500]	quality[+2],Sony[-2]	The quality, detail and clarity is much better than the Sony in my opinion. [Canon PowerShot SD500]	Canon[+3]	I did not conduct a rigorous test, but just took some identical shots in identical lighting with both cameras, and the Canon won hands down. [Canon PowerShot SD500]	pictures[+2]	Sharper pictures. [Canon PowerShot SD500]	size[+3]	The Canon is very small, definitely pocket size, but still easy to hold firmly. [Canon PowerShot SD500]	powers up[+3]	It powers up quickly, so you won't miss that quick shot. [Canon PowerShot SD500]	flash[-2]	The only knock I have is that the flash is underpowered. [Canon PowerShot SD500]	image[+2]	Good image quality. [Canon PowerShot SD500]	pics[+2],user interface[+2],battery charger[+2]	All I have to say is that the pics I get with my SD500 are both rich and color and high in detail, the user interface is awesome, the battery charger is tiny and super light and SD cards are relatively cheap and getting cheaper all the time.[Canon PowerShot SD500]	LCD[-1]	After reading reviews of LCD problems, cracked, black blobs etc, I figured that it was probably a very limited problem. [Canon PowerShot SD500]	LCD[-2]	After 57 pictures total the LCD went black except for the icons showing the settings. [Canon PowerShot SD500]	weight[+2]	Camera is a paper weight. [Canon PowerShot SD500]	SD500[+3]	I have been very impressed with my purchase of the SD500 I bought it at the beginning of the month as the ultimate pocket camera and have shot 300 images so far with it.[Canon PowerShot SD500]	pictures[+2]	The pictures are tack sharp, colors are vivid, and at 7 mega pixels the quality is plenty high to manipulate and crop images to your hearts desire. [Canon PowerShot SD500]	Powerup[+2]	Powerup is quick, and you can even set your favorite image to display for a second or so as it turns on. [Canon PowerShot SD500]	640x480 mode[+2],quality[+2]	I have especially enjoyed the 640x480 mode, while not a replacement for a dedicated video camera, its quality easily surpasses that of my old Hi-8 camera and is perfect for quick clips of things that still images just dont describe (max 8 mins at 640 30fps on a one gig card). [Canon PowerShot SD500]	Camera shake[-2]	you can set the optical zoom before shooting and than while shooting video adjust a digital zoom in and out however due to the cameras light weight Camera shake is a problem to contend with. [Canon PowerShot SD500]	Audio[+1]	Audio is mono and fairly acceptable, quiet also with little distortions. [Canon PowerShot SD500]	battery[+1]	The battery life is not that of the Casio's but its good and your going to get better pictures in my opionion with the battery life youve got. [Canon PowerShot SD500]	autofocus[-2]	The disadvantages of this camera is it has been having some trouble with its autofocus on a few occasional pictures, especially quick candid shots where you start up and shot as quick as you can. [Canon PowerShot SD500]	compact[-1]	I would imagine this is a problem with any camera of a compact nature. [Canon PowerShot SD500]	manual controls[-1]	Also as someone who at least knows a little bit about the technical work of taking a photo i really miss having manual controls. [Canon PowerShot SD500]	image[+2]	Glad to see the Ed. revised the previous statements regarding image quality. [Canon PowerShot SD500]	focuses[+2]	My SD500 focuses flawlessly, does not "whine" during video, and my pictures are razor sharp. [Canon PowerShot SD500]	camera[+2]	This camera is bulletproof. [Canon PowerShot SD500]	start up[+3]	start up is so quick – [Canon PowerShot SD500]	pictures[+1]	you can take pictures seconds after you turn the camera on...literally! [Canon PowerShot SD500]	lcd[+1]	big lcd screen - at least for me, 2" is enough[Canon PowerShot SD500]	picture[+3]	great picture quality - in automatic mode, quality is great. [Canon PowerShot SD500]	quality[+2]	when you learn how to change some settings, you can make the quality even better [Canon PowerShot SD500]	zoom[+1]	digital zoom is clear too...say you used all 3x optical zoom, try to do digital zoom then...just try not to shake the camera at all and you'll still get a clear good quality picture[Canon PowerShot SD500]	zoom[+1]	great video clip quality for a digital camera - so much better than my old one (Canon A60(?)...the 2.0 megapixel one). [Canon PowerShot SD500]	clips[+3]	i connected my camera to the tv and played some video clips and for a digital camera to take such good quality clips, i give it 5/5 stars =) oh and btw, while you take video clips, you can zoom it too! (digital zoom only though)...but still...(my old one can't do that...you have to zoom it first if you want then take the video clip.)[Canon PowerShot SD500]	merge pictures[+1]	photo stitch (merge pictures to create a panoramic one..even my old one can do this and it's really cool to have it now still)[Canon PowerShot SD500]	camera[+1]	turn the camera on while pressing the button (or is it the menu button? i have to check again =)) and it'l show you the time and date. [Canon PowerShot SD500]	battery[-1]	 battery life is not long enough IF and ONLY IF you take a lot of video clips and play it back on the camera a lot of times...the camera/battery gets a little bit warm too when you use it for a long time but it's normal. [Canon PowerShot SD500]	sound[-1]	the sound is not loud enough when i play back the video clips on the camera. [Canon PowerShot SD500]	camera[+3],pictures[+2]	i highly recommend this camera to anybody looking for a compact camera that can take good quality pictures. [Canon PowerShot SD500]	features[+3]	if you'll only read the whole manual, you'll find out even more cool features and you'll learn how to manipulate the quality you want to achieve and all those modes will make sense after reading [Canon PowerShot SD500]	camera[+1]	it's such a great camera! i think it really was worth the investment =)[Canon PowerShot SD500]	designed[+2]	if you haven't noticed, they designed it so that you can also take vertical pictures when you do the self-timer. [Canon PowerShot SD500]	made[+2]	they made the other end of the camera flat so you can put the camera upright on a flat surface if you don't like to take the usual horizontal pictures using the self-timer.[Canon PowerShot SD500]	camera[+2]	I bought this camera two days ago, and I'm very pleased to say that it has been worth the money. [Canon PowerShot SD500]	low-light conditions[-1]	Only downside is when taking pictures in low-light conditions without the flash. [Canon PowerShot SD500]	automatic settings[+2]	If you on the other hand always use automatic settings (and not manual) you should be just fine, as the camera features some of the best automatic settings I have ever seen.[Canon PowerShot SD500]	camera[+1]	All in all, this is the camera for you if you can spare the extra cost in price. [Canon PowerShot SD500]	Digic II chip[+3]	Having the Digic II chip helps a lot. [Canon PowerShot SD500]	pictures[+3],size[+3]	This camera takes amazing pictures and its size cannot be beat. [Canon PowerShot SD500]	starts up[+3]	I still can't believe how fast it starts up. [Canon PowerShot SD500]	camera[+3]	I take a lot of pictures and this camera is my first choice. [Canon PowerShot SD500]	sd500[+3]	I still have my s70 because I like the wider lens sometimes, but in general, if you are looking for a small camera with the whole package, the sd500 is the only one you should buy. [Canon PowerShot SD500]	edges[+2]	I love the rounded edges now, fits so much better in a pocket, jeans or suit. [Canon PowerShot SD500]	camera[+3],LCD[-2]	As much as I am happy about this great little camera, it is overshadowed by the fact that the LCD is easily spoilt.[Canon PowerShot SD500]	LCD[-2]	The SD500 has only been in my possession for a little over 3 months, and the LCD has been broken twice. [Canon PowerShot SD500]	LCD[-2]	I took it out one day and the LCD was not working. [Canon PowerShot SD500]	LCD[-2]	Although the SD500 takes great quality photos, the sensitivity of the LCD compromises the quality overall.[Canon PowerShot SD500]	camera[+2]	I tell you now, after lot of shooting in many different situations, this camera is amazing. [Canon PowerShot SD500]	size[+2]	The size of the camera is perfect. [Canon PowerShot SD500]	Fits[+2]	Fits comfortably in my inside jacket pocket or in my pants pocket. [Canon PowerShot SD500]	camera[+2]	there was no compromise this little camera does amazing things. [Canon PowerShot SD500]	pictures[+2]	I like to take pictures when I Go out at night and perhaps some people would complain that noise levels are high at higher iso's but I don't really care that much, i think it gives the pictures a certain real-life quality. [Canon PowerShot SD500]	flash[+2]	The flash is surprisingly good and even the video quality is excellent. [Canon PowerShot SD500]	camera[+1]	I'd be happy to talk to anyone about this camera. [Canon PowerShot SD500]	camera[+2],movie mode[+3]	This camera is an excellent choice for an ultracompact, take anywhere device and boasts an outstanding movie mode to boot. [Canon PowerShot SD500]	instruction[+3]	The instruction manuals and documentation are excellent so that the learning curve will be much less steep.[Canon PowerShot SD500]	camera[+2]	I've only had this camera for a few days, but it's been great. [Canon PowerShot SD500]	photo[+3]	The photo quality is amazing. [Canon PowerShot SD500]	feels[+3],looks[+3]	it's fast, feels great in your hand and looks great too. [Canon PowerShot SD500]	prints[+3]	I've printed several photos and the prints look as good as the screen views.[Canon PowerShot SD500]	image[+2]	As any digital camera owner knows is that when you go to take a picture of a moving object to expect some blurring but with some preliminary testing we had somone move there hands back and forth under the lense and another person take the picture and suprisingly a crystal clear image apeared on the decently sized screen. [Canon PowerShot SD500]	colors[+3],video[+3]	another thing i like about this camera is the way that you can swap colors around and the impressive video quality i would advise any person in the market for a camera to pay the little extra on the hefty $500 price tag and get a quality camera.[Canon PowerShot SD500]	camera[+2]	Moreover, apart from the plastic cable cover, the camera has a nice, solid feel about it, and it's so tiny, I take it with me wherever I go. [Canon PowerShot SD500]	camera[+2]	As it turns out, this is an awesome camera! [Canon PowerShot SD500]	preset[+3],user definable[+3]	However, this ultracompact allows the photographer to personalize his or her shooting preferences through a variety of preset and user definable modes. [Canon PowerShot SD500]	advanced controls[-1]	I also own a Canon Digital Rebel and I agree that the advanced controls on the SD500 are not as robust, but overall picture quality goes head-to-head with the Digital Rebel. [Canon PowerShot SD500]	software[+1],documentatio[+2]	The SD500 software install was seamless and the product documentation is very detailed. [Canon PowerShot SD500]	camera[+1]	Bottom line, this camera will give you a lot of bang for the buck![Canon PowerShot SD500]	pictures[+2]	I don't know why CNET says there is a problem with focus, I have all my pictures sharp and high quality. [Canon PowerShot SD500]	camera[+1]	Very good "every day" camera. Fits nicely in the pocket of my jeans and takes quality photos.[Canon PowerShot SD500]	looking[+2],fast[+3]	If you want a sharp looking, fast digital camera and you don't need or want manual controls, then this is the camera for you! [Canon PowerShot SD500]	camera[+3]	 am so glad I bought this camera. [Canon PowerShot SD500]	SD500[+3]	All the good reviews for the SD500 are true. [Canon PowerShot SD500]	view finder[+3]	The view finder shows crystal clear pictures that will look even better when you get them to the computer. [Canon PowerShot SD500]	software[+3]	The included software removes any red eye easily. [Canon PowerShot SD500]	pics[+3],small[+3]	if you are looking for a small camera to throw in your pocket, take great pics and video, get the SD500. [Canon PowerShot SD500]	camera[+1]	This is overall the best point and shoot camera I've used. [Canon PowerShot SD500]	buttons[+3],user interface[+3]	Placement of the buttons and software user interface is near perfect. [Canon PowerShot SD500]	power button[-1]	The only problem I have with the buttons is that the power button and print/share button don't have a nice click. [Canon PowerShot SD500]	buttons[-2]	The buttons are rather stiff. [Canon PowerShot SD500]	switch[+3]	I also tend to like the sliding cover/on switch found on many compact PS cameras since it's much faster and easier to power on if you need to take that instant shot. [Canon PowerShot SD500]	build[+1],macros-results[+2],video-quality[+3],flash[+3],white balance[+3]	overall build quality, good macros-results, impressive video-quality, good pictures with flash (good colours, sharp results), excellent auto white balance.[Canon PowerShot SD500]	camera[+1]	Could be better to be a perfect camera (and some competitors do some of this better): purple fringing, details in high-light area, noise over ISO100, red-eyes, (few)processing artefacts, (few)loss of some details especially of the hairs of peoples in low light, automatic autofocus, whizing while video-playback, better video comression (smaler viedo-files), more manual controls, longer lasting battery, indicator for battery, better protection of the LCD, less weight. [Canon PowerShot SD500]	camera[+2],image[+1]	When the overall image quality (especially natural colours, details, natural looking of the pictures) is the most important thing, then this camera ist top notch and very impressive. [Canon PowerShot SD500]	flash[+3]	In low light with flash I found it clear better then the sony P200 (too much red, colours overall not as natural but fewer red-eyes). [Canon PowerShot SD500]	settings[-1]	Some adjustments in the settings could help make it better.[Canon PowerShot SD500]	focus[+1]	I found best results in most situation with manual/center auto focus, manual mode, ISO 100 (shorter aperture-time, so more often sharper images as with ISO 50), auto white balance (auto white balance is better than of the other canon cameras I have and they already do very-well).[Canon PowerShot SD500]	camera[+1]	I upgraded from a very small 3.2 mpxl camera to this camera with great results. [Canon PowerShot SD500]	color[+3]	Good color and very little needed to correct photos on Paintshop Pro. [Canon PowerShot SD500]	Picture[+1]	Neat feature for self-timer allows you to record two different warnings. [Canon PowerShot SD500]	manual[+3]	The manual is excellent. [Canon PowerShot SD500]	multiple picture[+3]	Also, multiple picture feature is very, very fast.[Canon PowerShot SD500]	powerup[+2],multiple pictures[+3]	Very fast powerup and great speed when taking multiple pictures. [Canon PowerShot SD500]	size[+3]	Perfect size! Beats the competition by leaps and bounds. [Canon PowerShot SD500]	camera[+1]	I am impressed with this camera inside and out.[Canon PowerShot SD500]	camera[+3]	I love the camera.[Canon PowerShot SD500]	compact[+2],photo[+3]	This camera is perfect for the person who wants a compact camera that produces excellent photos in just about any situation. [Canon PowerShot SD500]	responce[+3]	The camera responce is VERY quick. [Canon PowerShot SD500]	pics[+1]	I have a Canon A 70 , and now this SD500, its amazing, how this little camera produces, such great pics, it even brings out ur pimples on the face. [Canon PowerShot SD500]	video[+3]	And the video quality is amazing. [Canon PowerShot SD500]	fits[+3]	And it fits right in my pocket much easier than my old S30. [Canon PowerShot SD500]	camera[-1]	I thought this camera was awful and I did tons of research on CNET and other sites. [Canon PowerShot SD500]	automatic shutter[-3]	There were many times when I clicked the automatic shutter and nothing happens. [Canon PowerShot SD500]	controls[-1]	The controls are hard to manipulate, especially in the dark. [Canon PowerShot SD500]	LCD[-2]	The LCD screen is too small since there are so many cameras that have larger ones.[Hitachi router]	performed[+2]	I purchased this router at a woodworking show after watching the CMT people using it to demo their bits and was impressed how it performed.[Hitachi router]	adjustment[-1]	The adjustment knob seemed ok, but when lowering the router, I have to practically pull it down while turning the knob.[Hitachi router]	collet[-1]	The collet for the 1/4 inch bits is a pain to get in and even harder to get out.[Hitachi router]	use[-2]	Then the most disappointing was trying to use Viper raised panel bits that just barely fit, and I mean just barely.[Hitachi router]	price[+2]	From the Internet, woodworking books, local stores and personal opinions the Hitachi M12V 3-1/4 HP router time and time again came up to be the router of choice or best for its price.[Hitachi router]	power[+1],speed[+1]	But I wanted to do some raised panel work and needed more power and variable speed to run the large-diameter bits.[Hitachi router]	power[+1],runs[+1],cuts[+1]	The Hitachi has plenty of power, runs smooth, and cuts effortlessly through maple (with Freud bits!)[Hitachi router]	bigger[-1][u][cc],heavier[-1][u][cc],use[-1]	However, it is much bigger, bulkier, and heavier than my other router and I would not like to use it freehand (I keep it mounted in a table).[Hitachi router]	plunge[+1]	Since I use it in a table, I don't use the plunge feature, but if I ever need it I've got it.[Hitachi router]	price[+2],power[+1],speed[+1],use[-1]	The Hitachi is a great router for a great price, but only get it if you need the maximum power, variable speed and use it in a table.[Hitachi router]	use[-1][s]	Otherwise, get a smaller single speed router, which will be much easier to use freehand and is all you need for smaller diameter bits.[Hitachi router]	looked[+1][u][cc]	The Hitachi is made in Malasyia, and looked cheap compared with the Makita, which is made in the USA.[Hitachi router]	worth[-1][cc][s]	If you think you are saving $40 getting the Hitachi, you are right, and you are also getting a router worth $40 less than a Makita.[Hitachi router]	pretty[-1][u]	It ain't cutting edge (no pun intended) state of the art with all the latest bells & whistles & it definitely ain't pretty.[Hitachi router]	smooth[+1][u],powerful[+1][u],affordable[+1][u],track record[+1]	But it is smooth, it is powerful, it is affordable & it has a proven track record.[Hitachi router]	adjustment[-1][s]	I built my own router table with a tilt up top & made a hand crank to replace the height adjustment knob & these two things make it easy to change out & raise or lower the bits.[Hitachi router]	costs[+1][u],router[+1]	So for the money it costs for one of those top-of-the-line models I've got a good router & a nice table to put it in & I like that.[Hitachi router]	router[+2]	Hitachi's M12V is a big beast of a router.[Hitachi router]	weight[-1][u][cc],power[-1],precise[-1]	It's not the heaviest around (I think Porter-Cable has that distinction), but I found its combination of weight and power really too much to allow precise handheld operation.[Hitachi router]	M12V[+2][u]	In my table the M12V has been a real champ.[Hitachi router]	heavy[+1][u],speed[+1]	The heavy motor and continuously variable speed control let this router churn through everything I threw at it.[Hitachi router]	controls[-1]	With the PlungeLIFT all my bit changing has been done above the table, although I still have to reach below the table to operate the spindle lock (and, of course, the speed and ON/OFF controls).[Hitachi router]	motor[+2],start[+2],speed[+1],price[+1]	Nice things about the M12V: - in a table, the powerful 3 1/4 HP motor is great - soft start helps a lot to control the beast when you turn the router on - continuously variable speed control - Amazon's price[Hitachi router]	weight[-1],power[-1],spindle[-1],chuck[-2]	Not so nice things: - a bit too much weight and power for easy handheld use - spindle lock makes for awkward bit changing (outside of a table) - the 1/4" chuck sleeve requires MUCH tightening to keep bits from slipping[Hitachi router]	router[+1][u]	This is truly a Clydesdale among the industry 3HP+ router workhorses.[Hitachi router]	solidity[+2][u],nimble[+1],used[+1]	Built like a tank, yet nimble enough to be comfortably used with the Leigh dovetail jig.[Hitachi router]	start[+2]	The soft start is a tremendous help for this type of operation.[Hitachi router]	heavy[-1][u],machine[+1][u],stability[+1]	It is a heavy but well-balanced machine, which is an asset when maximum stability is desired.[Hitachi router]	guide[+3]	The edge guide is top quality, easy to install and accurate.[Hitachi router]	speed[+1]	This was possible due to the variable speed settings for any sized bit.[Hitachi router]	adjustment[+1]	The height adjustment knob is a bit flimsy, but it works well and provides good accuracy.[Hitachi router]	collet[-1]	The only complaint I have is that the 1/4" collet will not sufficiently hold any of my 1/4" bits.[Hitachi router]	collet[-1]	The Hitachi collet simply was not ground accurately.[Hitachi router]	machine[+2][u]	This is a great deal, and I'm elated with my decision to go with Hitachi's green machine.[Hitachi router]	router[+3][u]	Wish I could give it 4 1/2 stars.[Hitachi router]	adjustment[+1],collet[+1]	I noticed that the micro adjustment knob and collet are well made and work well too.[Hitachi router]	speed[+2]	The speed control is well designed and it works perfectly.[Hitachi router]	guide[+1]	The included fence guide is easy to set up and quite accurate as well.[Hitachi router]	accessible[+1][u]	The plunge lock and power switch are very easily accessible which is a must when doing free hand routing.[Hitachi router]	heavy[+1],stable[+1][u]	It is heavy enough to make it stable, but not too heavy to preclude hand use.[Hitachi router]	plunge[-1]	The plunge action isn't smooth unless you make it so.[Hitachi router]	instructions[-1]	The instructions would benefit from some improvement and it would help if the RPMs of the speed settings were mentioned.[Hitachi router]	fit[-1],finish[-1]	Also, the fit and finish could be better although this doesn't detract from performance.[Hitachi router]	price[+2]	Overall this tool is very well worth the price and I have no regrets about my purchase.[Hitachi router]	money[+3]	This is an excellent router for the money.[Hitachi router]	plunge[-1]	The only problem i find with it is that the plunge mechanism will eventually stick due to wood dust.[Hitachi router]	springs[-1]	I find that if you remove the springs it is much easier to adjust and will not stick much.[Hitachi router]	money[+3]	Other than that, i think it is the best router for the money.[Hitachi router]	router[+2][u]	I must have gotten a good one.[Hitachi router]	adjustment[+1],control[+1],collet[+1]	I don't have problems with the depth adjustment, the speed control, the collet ( I haven't tried the 1/4" sleeve yet) .[Hitachi router]	Hitachi[+3][u][cc]	I would put the Hitachi up with the best![Hitachi router]	vibration[+2]	No vibration![Hitachi router]	plunging[+2]	Smooth plunging! ( it did stick a bit so I sprayed it w/ lubricant.[Hitachi router]	router[+2],adjustment[+1]	It is a great router for a table and with the depth adjustment knob it is easy to adjust depth prescisely.[Hitachi router]	shaft[+2]	It is very easy to change bits without removing the router from the table and the shaft lock works great.[Hitachi router]	balance[+2],lighter[+2][u][cs]	Very good balance in the hands and lighter than most 3 1/4 hp models.[Hitachi router]	start[+1]	The soft start is nice.[Hitachi router]	price[+3]	The price is incredible with the bonus pack and Hitachi's $25 incentive ( you need the code ---go to Toolseeker.com and it tells you)[Hitachi router]	price[+3]	The total price with delivery (free shipping ) was $135 ![Hitachi router]	cheap[+3][u]	Less than a cheap cordless drill or a laminate trimmer.[Hitachi router]	price[+2][u]	Saw the Hitachi on Amazon.com with their $25.00 coupon (at the time) and could not resist trying it out.[Hitachi router]	operate[+1]	UNLIKE other reviewers, I like the tool because it is easy to operate outside of the router table.[Hitachi router]	switch[+1],lock[+1]	Both the on/off switch (soft start) and the depth lock are within easy reach of the right hand.[Hitachi router]	heavy[+1][u][cc],router[+1][u][cc]	It is no more heavy than any other powerful router and not as bad as some Porter Cable models I tried.[Hitachi router]	spring[-1]	1. Your Hitachi might come to you with a stiff spring mechanism.[Hitachi router]	spring[-2][p]	Mine was so bad I had to to use a hammer to free it (and this is why I'm giving it 4, not 5 stars).[Hitachi router]	sawdust[-1]	I have noted that as you use the tool, sawdust builds in the channel and it requires attention.[Hitachi router]	sawdust[-1][p]	Not a killer problem, but not well done, either.[Hitachi router]	use[+1],result[+1]	For me, it is as important that the tool be comfortable to use as it is that it produce a high-quality result.[Hitachi router]	price[+2]	Can recommend the Hitachi in this ergonomic arena -- at the price quoted on Amazon it is a bargain.[Hitachi router]	M12[+3][u][cc]	After getting used to the M12 all the rest seemed lacking.[Hitachi router]	router[+1][u],plunge[+2]	On top of being a workhorse and ultra reliable, it is just a plunge router that works really well.[Hitachi router]	use[+2]	I use it in the table (never take the springs out - just attach the fine adjustment knob), in my woodrat and freehand and it works great in all circumstances.[Hitachi router]	slop[-1]	The only beef that I have with it is that there is a little too much slop in the columns when the lock is not engaged.[Hitachi router]	big[-1][u]	If it weren't so big I would probably by another since no shop is complete without a handful of routers..[Hitachi router]	router[+2][u]	What an upgrade!!![Hitachi router]	starts[+2],runs[+2]	I have only used it with the 1/4" collet and a 1/2" round over bit, but I love how it starts up with little torque and runs very quietly.[Hitachi router]	adjustment[+2][cc]	The depth adjustment and bit changing is much easier on the M12V than it was on my old router.[Hitachi router]	use[+2], vibration[+1]	The handles make it very comfortable to use and I experience little vibration.[Hitachi router]	price[+3]	Combine this with the excellent price we got in the Gold Box, and I'm really happy.[Hitachi router]	router[+2][u]	I'm sure I don't use it to the degree of some of the other purchasers, but I really like it![Hitachi router]	router[+2]	I first used the router in the free hand mode and liked it a lot.[Hitachi router]	stable[+2][u],use[+2],visibility[+2]	I find it very stable and comfortable to use, it doesn't jump around or make me feel like I need to use a lot of arm strength to keep it under control, and  it has very good visibility to see your cut.[Hitachi router]	fence[+1]	It came with a good fence that  is simple yet precise and thats well made and won't break.[Hitachi router]	controls[+1]	Also I like the  position of all the controls and the fact that it doesn't have any extra  knobs or gizmos.[Hitachi router]	simple[+1][u]	I prefer things that are simple.[Hitachi router]	power[+2],control[+1]	The router has plenty  of power for any type of bit or wood I need to cut, and the speed control  knob is easy to get to.[Hitachi router]	guide[-1]	I did have to cut off the ears  that hold the  template guide in place so I could get those big panel raising bits in it.[Hitachi router]	springs[-1]	I also removed the springs in the plunge  tubes to make it easier to raise.[Hitachi router]	adjustments[-1]	I added a crank for those times when I  need to make fine adjustments, but I seldom use it.[Hitachi router]	wrench[-1]	I also put a bend in  the wrench so I can remove and install bits from the top of the table.[Hitachi router]	system[+2]	Its  not a perfect system but its a very good one.[Hitachi router]	router[+1]	I've owned this router for over 8 years and am somewhat satisfied with it.[Hitachi router]	quiet[+1][u],power[+2]	It is quiet and has plenty of power.[Hitachi router]	stability[+1][u],weight[+1]	I find that it is stable in my hands and its' weight actually contributes to that stability.[Hitachi router]	plunging[-1]	That said, I am disappointed in the plunging mechanism.[Hitachi router]	shafts[-1]	Shortly after I brought it, the plunging shafts started sticking.[Hitachi router]	shafts[-1][p]	After repeatly cleaning and recleaning, it still stuck after using it for a little while.[Hitachi router]	plunge[-1]	I no longer use it as a plunge router, only as a stationary or table mounted router.[Hitachi router]	plunging[-1],router[+2][s]	If the plunging action isn't that important, then this is a great router.[Hitachi router]	plunging[-2]	If the plunging action is critical to your work, look elsewhere.[Hitachi router]	performance[+2],features[+2]	I love the performance and features of this router.[Hitachi router]	money[+3]	For the money, I'm not sure you can do better.[Hitachi router]	quiet[+2][u],adjustment[+2],speed[+2]	It's very quiet for a universal motor-driven tool, and the height adjustment stick and variable speed control are great.[Hitachi router]	plunging[+1]	Smooth plunging mechanism.[Hitachi router]	fence[+1]	The guide fence for freehand routing is well made and solid.[Hitachi router]	grip[-1],chuck[-1],collet[-1]	It's oftentimes hard to get a good grip on the router, activate the chuck lock, and get enough muscle behind the wrench to get the collet loosened up.[Hitachi router]	router[+2],performer[+2]	Even with that, I highly recommend this router - outstanding performer.[Hitachi router]	router[+1][u]	I purchased two of these beauties.[Hitachi router]	router[+2]	I have a tendency to do quite a bit of research before I drop money on a tool and everyone I talked to loved this router.[Hitachi router]	router[+3]	One cabinet shop has been using one regularly in a router table for 11 years without a problem.[Hitachi router]	collets[+3]	The design of the collets is excellent and far exceeds any of the craftman (toy/junk) routers I have previously purchased.[Hitachi router]	collets[+1][p],power[+2]	They were easy to setup with plenty of power to hog through anything I have encountered.[Hitachi router]	money[+2]	I have less money invested in the router table and dual routers than I would have if I had purchased a single cheap reliant shaper.[Hitachi router]	setup[+2]	The setup works awesome, as with any tool I look closely at the individual tool for it's merits, and not just the company as a whole.[Hitachi router]	router[+2]	I would however highly recommend the m12v router ![Hitachi router]	Hitachi M12V[+2][u]	I'm not overly fond of GREEN but when I used this Hitachi M12V it turns out that now I'm very fond of it.[Hitachi router]	operation[+1],speed[+1]	The smooth operation variable speed and a set of good Jasada Bits will provide just the right combination for great predictable results.[Hitachi router]	router[+1][u]	Its well made and user friendly.[Hitachi router]	router[+2][u]	You'll love it![Hitachi router]	router[+3][u]	It is currently permanently mounted (3 years now) in my router table and will most likely stay there until its shot.[Hitachi router]	start[+1],runs[+1]	This router has soft start and runs smooth and true.[Hitachi router]	router[+1]	I use the router with a 3 1/2in raised panel bit with no problems.[Hitachi router]	power[+1]	It has enough power to hog out all the material in one pass, but I usually take multiple to prevent blowout and a smoother finish.[Hitachi router]	price[+3]	For the price, I am considering purchasing a spare just to have as a backup.[Hitachi router]	router[+2][u]	You just can't go wrong with this one![Hitachi router]	router[+1][u]	Enjoy.[Hitachi router]	price[+3]	This is an excellent router for the price.[Hitachi router]	router[+3][u]	The first one lasted about 6 years of heavy use.[Hitachi router]	tool[+1][u],powerful[+1][u]	This is a well-made and powerful tool.[Hitachi router]	price[-1][cc]	I was some what sceptical when I seen the price deference between the other makers of comparible HP.[Hitachi router]	M12V[+2][u]	The M12V has been great.[Hitachi router]	adjustment[+1]	The height adjustment works well- not perfect.[Hitachi router]	bog[+1]	The wood can be pushed thru fast or slow with little bog.[Hitachi router]	quite[+1][u],workload[+1],cheap[+3][u]	What I really like about- its quite, it can handle my workload and it was so cheap that I can throw it away and buy another one without blinking.[Hitachi router]	router[-3]	This router was a huge disapointment.[Hitachi router]	adjustment[-1]	The depth adjustment was sloppy.[Hitachi router]	control[-1]	The speed control is recessed too far in the housing and required a tool (screwdriver or dowel rod) to effect any speed change.[Hitachi router]	control[-1][u]	It was impossible to change the speed with just my fingers.[Hitachi router]	control[-1][u]	My son tried it and he too couldn't change the speed without an assist.[Hitachi router]	heft[+1]	I did like the heft of the machine.[Hitachi router]	stable[+1][u],heavy[-1][u]	It felt rather stable in my hands (heavy though.)[Hitachi router]	router[-2][u],control[-1]	I sent it back, as I think that the speed control is either poorly designed or defective.[Hitachi router]	router[-1][u]	All in all, not very good.[Hitachi router]	price[-1],router[+3][u]	I was skeptical about this router due to low price but have been totally impressed using it.[Hitachi router]	power[+3]	The power is incredible, it cut through MDF and plywood like butter.[Hitachi router]	adjust[+1]	The edge guide has a nice micro adjust feature that works well.[Hitachi router]	adjustment[-1]	The only not-so-positive comment I have is about the depth adjustment, it is not easy to micro-adjust accurately.[Hitachi router]	price[+2],router[+2][u]	I do not count this as a negative, however, because it is not that much of a nuisance and at the price for what you get this router is way too good to pass up!!![Hitachi router]	router[+2]	The ones I've kept (Porter Cables, Dewalts, Bosch, and this Hitachi) have proven their worth over the years, however, when I need a real workhorse, I grab this router.[Hitachi router]	machine[+2][u]	I recently had to run a 3/4" straight bit through hard maple to make a deep dado and was amazed that this machine didn't even slow down.[Hitachi router]	router[+2][u]	I could take 1/2" passes and it still didn't skip a beat.[Hitachi router]	Hitachi[+1][u]	I've yet to find the limitation for this Hitachi (my only Hitachi tool, by the way) and quite frankly, I don't know that I have the muscle to push this machine any harder.[Hitachi router]	price[+3][u]	Bottom line is that at $160, this is an absolute steal.[Hitachi router]	router[+3]	I've got a buddy who's trying to offload his almost new $300 Speedmatic because he saw what this router can do.[Hitachi router]	router[+3][u]	It is without even a slight doubt, my new favorite.[Hitachi router]	starts[+2],speeds[+2],depth[+2],power[+2]	The Hitachi M12V is a dream to work with, smooth starts, adjustable speeds, micro-adjustable depth, and plenty of power to spare.[Hitachi router]	router[+3][u]	I couldn't believe what I had been missing.[Hitachi router]	router[+3]	If you're looking for a 3hp plunge router, the Hitachi M12V is your best bet to stretch your equipment budget.[Hitachi router]	router[+3][u]	I'll be getting a second one for my router table![Hitachi router]	power[+2]	I have been impressed with the power of the Hitachi M12V.[Hitachi router]	bog[+1]	It doesn't bog down under load.[Hitachi router]	Cuts[+1]	Cuts are easy and smooth.[Hitachi router]	works[+1]	I use it on a router table, and it is works well.[Hitachi router]	adjustment[-1]	The major reasons I didn't give it a five are:  One, I didn't think the fine adjustment worked well.[Hitachi router]	adjustment[-2][p][cc]	I replaced it with a Router Raizer and it works much better.[Hitachi router]	wrench[-1]	Two, the single wrench just doesn't work well.[Hitachi router]	latch[-1]	The sliding latch is does not stay in place.[Hitachi router]	router[+2]	Other than this, I am very pleased with the router and would buy it again.[Hitachi router]	price[+2]	I really liked the price...[Hitachi router]	control[+1]	I like the speed control.[Hitachi router]	power[+2]	It has plenty of power.[Hitachi router]	adustment knob[-1]	The fine adustment knob which came with the router was very difficult to use on a router table.[Hitachi router]	Router Razier[-1]	Finally, I gave up and I purchased a Router Razier.[Hitachi router]	wrench[-1]	I am seriously considering purchasing another wrench and just not using the "sliding wrench" which comes on the router.[Hitachi router]	router[+1]	All in all I am pleased with the router.[Hitachi router]	power[+1],noise[+1],control[+1]	The power, low noise operation, and speed control makes up for the problems I have experienced.[Hitachi router]	heavy[-1][u]	It it is a bit heavy for hand held work, but any router this size will be.[Hitachi router]	control[-1]	Recenly the variable speed control went out.[Hitachi router]	control[-1][p]	It would work fine for a while then as the motor warmed up it would die.[Hitachi router]	plunge[-1]	The only other problem with this router that I have encountered is the plunge action will start to stick, then it needs to be cleaned and lubricated.[Hitachi router]	router[+2][u]	Overall it is a great value.[Hitachi router]	price[+3]	For the price I don't think you can beat it.[Hitachi router]	tool[+3][u]	This is a fantastic tool to use.[Hitachi router]	heavy[-1][u]	Only problem is that is a bit heavy.[Hitachi router]	product[+1]	This is a quality product, not to be confused with teh cheap junk that Hitachi gets manufactured in China.[Hitachi router]	last[-1][u]	They last about 1 1/2 years until the problems start.[Hitachi router]	safety[-2]	My first router is a safety hazard if you do not pay attention and are not very careful.[Hitachi router]	router[+2],money[+2]	When the router is working it is a very nice machine for the money.[Hitachi router]	safety[-1][u]	Luckily the soft start helped before it took the wood and tossed it or worse case, a finger.[Hitachi router]	depth[-1]	Once a depth is locked, it will jump off a little while working.[Hitachi router]	depths[-1]	You must keep double checking depths.[Hitachi router]	machine[+1][u],money[+1]	But, for the money it is a good machine.[Hitachi router]	duration[-1][u]	Well, my second one is now beginning to hicup a bit after about 1 1/2 years.[Hitachi router]	control[-1]	The electronic speed control is not doing it's job and the router begins to speed up and slow down at will.[Hitachi router]	router[+1][u][s]	For the hobbiest, it's probably a nice buy.[Hitachi router]	equipment[+1][u][s]	For the person that uses the equipment every day, pay the extra and get a reliable & safer unit.[Hitachi router]	safety[-1][u][s]	If this machine just stops on you, unplug it quickly and get out of the way![Nokia 6600]	phone[+3][u]	I've had this beauty for nearly 2 months now and I truely love it.[Nokia 6600]	battery life[-2]	The only disappointment so far has been battery life.[Nokia 6600]	battery life[-2][u]	Mine generally requires a charege every 48 hours or so and I don't really talk on it that much.[Nokia 6600]	phone[+3][p]	It has it all.[Nokia 6600]	phone[+3]	This is the first phone I know of that has the large bright screen, infrared, bluetooth, USB connector and a speakerphone.[Nokia 6600]	phone[+3]	If you are looking for an upgrade, this is definitely the phone for you.[Nokia 6600]	size[cs][+2]	3660 had similar features, but that is big in size.[Nokia 6600]	6600[+3]	6600 looks and feels nice.[Nokia 6600]	bluetooth[+3]	This one is full of features(has bluetooth).[Nokia 6600]	LCD[+3]camera quality[+3]	Especially the LCD is big and the camera quality is among the very best around.[Nokia 6600]	PDA[+3]	I have set up it's PDA features with avantgo.com where you can download info from sites like weather,mapquest maps/directions into it, which is great.[Nokia 6600]	s/w[+3]	Using supplied s/w, you can transfer all addresses from a different nokia phone into it.[Nokia 6600]	battery life[+3][u]	Goes ~3 days after a charge.[Nokia 6600]	phone[-1][cs]	I purchased this phone knowing it was slightly old as compared to the newer models of Nokia phones available.[Nokia 6600]	priced[-2]	I thought it was kind of steeply priced at that time.[Nokia 6600]	phone[+3]	I must add to the dismay/delight of readers this phone is simply the most groundbreaking phone mankind has ever held.[Nokia 6600]	use[+3]	It has raised the bar owing to number of features it offers and the absolute ease of use delight.[Nokia 6600]	keypad[+3]	1.The Phone has the best keypad any Nokia phone has to offer.[Nokia 6600]	keypad[+3][cc]	Believe me when I say this I have used and fingered all Nokia phones and the 6600 has the best keypad[Nokia 6600]	look[+2]	I must admit its not the best looking phone ever but then it has this look of static and absolute conviction that looks like everything a phone should be[Nokia 6600]	interface[+3]	3. The Nokia 6600 has a brilliant Java interface.[Nokia 6600]	MMC card[+3][u]	The Phone offers a 32 Mb MMC card and I think that is certainly the most exciting feature.[Nokia 6600]	Capacity[+3]	Capacity is not a problem here.[Nokia 6600]	Build[+3]	4. The Build is just right.[Nokia 6600]	sturdy[+3][u]	The phone is sturdy.[Nokia 6600]	build[+3][u]	I've dropped it atleast a dozen times to my recolletion and it still works as good as ever.[Nokia 6600]	phone[+3][u]	Its a tough one this unless you wanna drive your car over it.[Nokia 6600]	phone[+3][u]	This isn't the most rugged phone ever but then your not gonna play aeroplane with this,are you.[Nokia 6600]	Camera[+3]	5.The Camera installed on this phone is awesome.[Nokia 6600]	bluetooth[+3]	I click pictures in JPG format and because the phone has a bluetooth device I find it extremely easy to transfer pics to my pc and forth.[Nokia 6600]	display[+3][u]	The display and brightness on this phone is quite extraordinary.[Nokia 6600]	colors[+3]	The use of 65536 (16bit) colors ensures you get your share of animations and icons on your phone[Nokia 6600]	upgradibility[+3]	It has great upgradibility.[Nokia 6600]	log[+3]	The log functions helps you track down the incoming , outgoing calls in the most easy of ways.[Nokia 6600]	handsfree[+3]	The handsfree provided by the phone is useful for those who talk on the phone while driving.[Nokia 6600]	processor[-3]ear volume[-2][cs]	Anyhow some demerits of this phone, The phone has a slow processor and the ear volume is lower than 6610 but then the 6610 has the best ear volume among most Nokia variants.[Nokia 6600]	battery life[-2]	The battery life of this phone is at most 2 days and at least one day at excessive use.[Nokia 6600]	Video recording[-2]	Video recording is limited at just 9 seconds.[Nokia 6600]	upgrade[-1][u]	You can upgrade but then there's a certain level of trouble involved.[Nokia 6600]	phone[+3]	This makes for a great phone.[Nokia 6600]	phone[-3]	I've had Nokia's for years, and while this one is packed with whiz bang features it is disappointing for its primary use - a phone.[Nokia 6600]	phone[-3]	On the plus side it's packed with features, including BlueTooth that works fine - it's really a tiny computer that is also a phone... and that's the negative.[Nokia 6600]	screen[-3][u]	As a computer, or PDA its weak since the screen, while large by phone standards, is still tiny to really do anything on.[Nokia 6600]	dial[-3]	When you dial a number, you'll need to check the screen to see that the number entered is correct.[Nokia 6600]	keys[-3]	You'll do that because the keys are tightly packed in and your fingers will likely press two keys at once.[Nokia 6600]	screen[-3][u]	I hope you have a magnifying glass, because the number displayed as well as most of the pop up options are tiny.[Nokia 6600]	screen[-3]	It's as though Nokia has segregated 90% of the screen for fancy features rarely used and leave just 10% for the day to day use.[Nokia 6600]	phone[-3]	I've have many Nokia's and while this is the best for features, it's the worst as a phone.[Nokia 6600]	feels[+2],bluetooth[-2]	This phone is flashy and feels good in the hand, but it could not hold a connection to any of my bluetooth devices (headset, handheld, or desktop computer).[Nokia 6600]	phone[-2][cc]	My old Siemens s56, on the other hand, worked beautifully with all of the above.[Nokia 6600]	camera[-3]	who in the hell needs a frigging *VGA* camera on their CELLPHONE???[Nokia 6600]	phone[+3][p]	since then, i have not found one major problem with it.[Nokia 6600]	camera[+3]PDA[+3]	i highly recommend it if you are looking for a phone with great camera quality and/or lots of features you would find in a PDA.[Nokia 6600]	bulky[-1][u],features[+3][p]	Sure, it is a relatively bulky, but it is really packed with many great features.[Nokia 6600]	bluetooth[+3]transfer[+3]	I own this phone for about 6 months now, I have used the following features: bluetooth connection to laptop and desktop for sync contacts and calendars with Outlook, transfer files (movies, songs), I have many movies on it now with a 512MB memory card that it takes.[Nokia 6600]	Handsfree[+2]	Handsfree future is good, but not too exciting.[Nokia 6600]	Camera[+2],video recording[-1]	Camera is nice, and video recording for some reason is only limited to 9 seconds.[Nokia 6600]	slow[-2],bluetooth[-2]	Only thing I don't like about it is slow in changing apps, boot up, and sometime it has problem connect thru bluetooth.[Nokia 6600]	looking[+2]	This one has a good looking.[Nokia 6600]	look[+2][u]	It's oval and... nice.[Nokia 6600]	shape[+2],keypad[+2],joystick[+2]	I like it's shape and it's keypad and joystick.[Nokia 6600]	use[+3],small[+3][u]	It's easy to use. Not too small, and not too big.[Nokia 6600]	screen[+2]	The screen is quite big (between all handphone), but the just about 65000 color.[Nokia 6600]	camera[-2]	And, other else,  the camera is still VGA.[Nokia 6600]	slow[-2][p]	I must say, this one is quite slow to open an application.[Nokia 6600]	phone[-2][p]	Sometimes, it needs few minutes to open an application.[Nokia 6600]	phone[+2][p]	Few month ago, it's very popular among my community.[Nokia 6600]	phone[+2][p]	It's good.[Nokia 6600]	phone[-1][p]	But not good enough for me.[Nokia 6600]	color[+3]	:! OK, score 7.0 Oh yes, the newest color of this phone is quite cool.[Nokia 6600]	Nokia[-2][cc]	I have overall been disappointed with Nokia in the past, finding that Samsung and Motorola tended to have better quality phones.[Nokia 6600]	6600[+2][cc]	While this phone obviously doesn't have the same quality construction as Motorola does, the Nokia 6600 is one of the better phones I've used.[Nokia 6600]	versatility[+3]features[+3]	What makes it so great is the versatility and the number of features it has.[Nokia 6600]	audio quality[+3]	1) Great audio quality overall.[Nokia 6600]	audio quality[+3]	Handset quality is great, as is the speakerphone quality and the headset audio quality.[Nokia 6600]	camera[+3]	A decent camera phone for taking quick pictures, movies, and having general all around fun with.[Nokia 6600]	joystick[+3]	3) The joystick design they are using on the new Nokias gives you a great degree of control.[Nokia 6600]	joystick[-2]	The only problem is that occasionally the joystick does start to dig into your thumb while gaming.[Nokia 6600]	ring tone[+3],game[+3]	4) One nice thing about Nokias is that they have a ton of ring tone and game choices.[Nokia 6600]	Nokia[+3]	If you love your cell phone games or changing your ring tones everyday, Nokia beats everyone else.[Nokia 6600]	Bluetooth[+3]	5) Bluetooth wireless technology, so that I can transfer data to and from my computer without messing with any cables.[Nokia 6600]	wide[+2][u]	6) The phone is really wide, which seems to be a turnoff for many people, but the phone is actually easier to grip and feel more ergonomic.[Nokia 6600]	small[+3][u]	I feel much less likely to drop this phone than others, which are actually starting to get too small.[Nokia 6600]	[s]	You will probably have to get a belt clip for it, however, unless you wear the pants with the cargo pockets.[Nokia 6600]	construction[-2]	My biggest concern is that I have found Nokia phones lower quality construction to lead to lower prices, but they also don't last as long.[Nokia 6600]	construction[+1][u]	I can tell using the phone that it feels a little flimsier than Motorolas do, but as long as I'm not planning on dropping the phone or running over it with my car it should be just fine.[Nokia 6600]	[s]	I wouldn't use it for business purposes and hand one out to all my employees, because you tend to want a little more rugged a phone for that.[Nokia 6600]	phone[+3]	Other than that it meets or surpasses all of my needs and surely won't disappoint any already established Nokia phone fans.[Nokia 6600]	interface[-2]	OPERATION: It's like BMW's I-Drive - It does it's job, but has the most unintuitive, overly-layered interface.[Nokia 6600]	operation[-2][u]	The phone must be shut down & taken apart to change the memory card... and turning the phone back on takes a little while.[Nokia 6600]	instruction booklet[-2]	Even the instruction booklet is out of order.[Nokia 6600]	applications[+2]	APPLICATIONS: It has lots of applications and they work very well... when you eventually find where they are and they finally open.[Nokia 6600]	applications[-2]	No matter how accustomed to the phone you become, too much time is required to get to, open and close applications.[Nokia 6600]	6600[+2][u]	The 6600 has more ameneties than most - World phone, Camera (VGA/zoom/night mode/timer), Video (w/ audio & zoom), Speaker (good sound), Bluetooth, infrared, Modem for computers, electronic wallet, Internet access, Calendar, calculator, converter and more.[Nokia 6600]	phone[-2][u]	The phone does not have an Mp3-player, FM radio, 200k+ color screen, megapixel camera, quad band, PDA, photo editor.[Nokia 6600]	DEPENDABILITY[+3]	DEPENDABILITY: I've seen no glitches.[Nokia 6600]	phone[+3][u]	I've had no problems w/ this phone.[Nokia 6600]	keys[-2][u]	STYLING/ERGONOMICS: The keys are small, which generally doesn't bother me if they are spaced because I can employ a little 'Braille,' but the keys run into each other, so careful attn. must be paid when dialing.[Nokia 6600]	stylized[-2][u]	It's not as stylized as a Sony or Samsung.[Nokia 6600]	big[+2][u]	Although it has chubby hips, the device isn't really so big.[Nokia 6600]	screen[+3]	Solid, squeak-free, large screen.[Nokia 6600]	MEMORY[+3]	MEMORY/STORAGE - Seemingly boundless.[Nokia 6600]	memory[+3]	First of all, the phone houses a great deal of memory for multiple videos, sound clips, photos, texts, etc.[Nokia 6600]	transmission[+3]	Secondly, all info can be sent to a computer and w/o the hassle of USB wires.[Nokia 6600]	6600[+3],mhz[+3]	The 6600 (T-Mobile) is the true 'world phone' in that it has the mhz to operate around the globe, including New Zealand and Australia (900) whereas the  6620 (available from Cingular) replaces it w/ 800mhz (some refer to as 850).[Nokia 6600]	coverage[+3][u]	The latter will provide better coverage in more remote areas of The States but still operates in many countries, excluding New Zealand and Australia.[Nokia 6600]	6600[-2],service[-1]	The 6600 will provide similar service in more developed areas of The States and not as well in more remote areas.[Nokia 6600]	6600[+3]	As the 6600 uses 900mhz, it operates in more countries than the 6620.[Nokia 6600]	battery life[+1]	The battery life is less than stellar, but it charges w/ the quickness.[Nokia 6600]	operating system[+3]	Remember, this phone uses an operating system - Symbian... and it's feature-rich w/ 65k colors.[Nokia 6600]	video[+3]	It films 10 second video, for crying out loud.[Nokia 6600]	battery life[-1]	The battery life can't be very long; let's not be greedy.[Nokia 6600]	game[-3]	Don't use them, so I delete them for addtl space.[Nokia 6600]	[s]	IMP: Two important pieces of advice - Visit Nokia's site.[Nokia 6600]	downloads[+3]	There are number of downloads needed/available for this phone & they will be texted to you at no cost.[Nokia 6600]	[s]	The second piece of advice - Be prepared to spend a lot of time w/ this phone.[Nokia 6600]	phone[+2][cc]	A Sony Ericcson may be the phone for you... but good luck finding one w/ all the features & such a competitive price.[Nokia 6600]	[s]	Keep in mind that for nearly every screen, there are a number 'along side' and 'beneath' them... for every 'save,' there are choices of phone memory, memory card or sim card.[Nokia 6600]	phone[+3]	Despite a critical start, this phone deserves four stars because it accomplishes what it sets out to do (which is pretty lofty)... does more than most... does it well... is dependable.[Nokia 6600]	phone[-2]	When you consider expandability (downloads via computer), the numerous features, two transmission programs and multiple storage devices, dependability - this is a phone that isn't easy to out-grow.[Nokia 6600]	[u]	I would suggest this phone for all but the simple-minded... or those who simply don't need so many features.[Nokia 6600]	BLUETOOTH[-3]	BLUETOOTH DOES NOT WORK ON THIS PHONE.[Nokia 6600]	Bluetooth[-3]	Though nearly a dozen different people at both T-Mobile and Nokia have told me otherwise, it is simply not possible to use this phone as a Bluetooth modem for the vast majority of PDAs and many other devices.[Nokia 6600]	PHONE[-3]	Only then did I learn the truth -- THIS PHONE DOES NOT WORK WITH PALM PDAS![Nokia 6600]	nokia[-3]	This simple nuance was too much for Nokia, and they still refuse to acknoledge the fact that their technician could have broken the phone or repair the phone for free.[Nokia 6600]	Nokia[-3]	In short - Nokia themselves don't know that this phone doesn't work with the Palm, and if you don't heed my advice you will spend hours with technicians around the globe reading from scripts, chiding you in broken english for not following their directions exactly.[Nokia 6600]	Nokia[-3]	Ultimately you will learn just how bad Nokia is, and why their recent loss of market share is so utterly deserved.[Nokia 6600]	photos[-3]	The photos in the address book are terribly scaled too; they look as though they were built out of legos.[Nokia 6600]	phone[+3]	This phone is one of the best I've ever used.[Nokia 6600]	phone[+3][p]	It has everything I needed: bluetooth, infrared, support for MMC, camera, and a good operating system with lots of supporting software.[Nokia 6600]	phone[+2][cs]	I would have given this phone 5 stars if it wasn't for the fact that I would rather use my 3330 to do all the most common things you do with a phone.[Nokia 6600]	interface[-3]	It's important that people know the following:  First, the interface is slow.[Nokia 6600]	interface[-3][u]	You hit the message button on the front and it takes a matter of SECONDS to bring up the menu.[Nokia 6600]	lag[-3],useable[-2]	Secondly, in addition to the lag each time you give a command, it's just not that easily useable on the go.[Nokia 6600]	number buttons[-3],fonts[-1],interface[-2]	The number buttons are crammed into a 3x4cm area, the fonts are small, the interface is too convoluted and frustrating, it's not that customisable as well.[Nokia 6600]	look[+3],battery life[+3],memory[+3]	The plusses are the features, look, good signal and battery life, memory size and robustness.[Nokia 6600]	camera[+2],video[+2]	The camera and video functionality is decent, I can't see myself wasting my time with it, but some people will.[Nokia 6600]	[s]	All in all I would say wait for the cell phone companies to create a PDA/cell hybrid that is efficient and easy to use as a phone.[Nokia 6600]	phone[+3]	this is a great phone i have this phone since Feb 04 and i never have any problem at all.[Nokia 6600]	features[+3],camera[+3],ringtones[+3],bluetooth[+3]	very cool features... great camera with zoom...cool quality pictures... great ringtones... bluetooth feature is great....[Nokia 6600]	[s]	If you are purchasing this phone, then make sure you can handle the speed of this phone.[Nokia 6600]	phone[-3][u]	This phone is not suitable for fast people, maybe only for old people.[Nokia 6600]	slow[-3][u]	The menu pops up after 3 seconds The picture takes a while to load from its slow card memory.[Nokia 6600]	time[-3][u]	The navigation takes so much time that it would eventually drive you crazy.[Nokia 6600]	[s]	If you find a better phone, then I suggest you go for it.[Nokia 6600]	big[-2][u]	At first glance, I thought this phone was a little too big for me, maybe a little too complicated.[Nokia 6600]	phone[+3][p]	This thing does everything but washes your dishes.[Nokia 6600]	modem[+3][p]	I can use it as a modem for my computer, connect with clients and friends, the possibilities are endless.[Nokia 6600]	ringtones[+3],screen[+3]	The ringtones are beautiful, the screen is super high quality.[Nokia 6600]	carrier[-3]	I can NOT find a carrier for this phone I like, end up just tossing it in my purse.[Nokia 6600]	phone[+3]	I do not need to repeat what's great about this phone.[Nokia 6600]	Phone card calling[-3]	This phone doesn't include Phone card calling.[Nokia 6600]	phone card calling[-3]	This process can be very annoying and unsafe when you are driving a stick shift on the highway.[Nokia 6600]	feature[-3][cc]	My old Sony Ericsson T610 has this feature.[Nokia 6600]	hear[-3][u]	In noisy environment, it's hard to hear from the earpiece.[Nokia 6600]	volume[-3][u]	Speaker volume is loud and clear but it sacrifaces the battery life.[Nokia 6600]	phone[-3][p]	Unfortunately , I sold it exactly a month later .[Nokia 6600]	volume[-3]	1-A cell phone is to make CALLS , in other words , quality of reception and mic/speaker are the most important , the 6600 has a relatively low volume speaker , you'd have to press it hard against your ear to hear anything the other person is saying , unless the surroundings were completely quiet .[Nokia 6600]	bulky[-3][u],buttons[-3]	2- It is bulky and the small buttons on the sides are sloppy to use .[Nokia 6600]	SLOW[-3][cs]	3- It is SLOW , if you keep the original configuration and progs (why'd u buy it then ?!) it'll run smoothly , but still slower than most other coloured-screen Nokias .[Nokia 6600]	phone[-3]	4- My idea was that it was an all-in-one , and that theory -once again- proves wrong , this phone excells at nothing , less  than average in everything , if you seriously need any of the "other than phone" functionalities , you'll be disappointed .... if you have lots of money and bought it for the love of gadgets then fine .... but don't expect to get much done .[Nokia 6600]	features[-3]	Basically the 6600 is a bundle of over-hyped features you don't and won't need (if you do get yourself a PDA or pocket PC) , none of them work as they should , and the basic phone functions and ergonomics are less than average .[Nokia 6600]	phone[-3][cs]	I'm an advocate of Nokia , but this phone and the following models (7610) , are seemingly a desperate trial at squeezing as much under-engineered and experimental technologies in one sloppy phone .[Nokia 6600]	phones[-3][cs]	I'm giving it 1 star because as compared to other Nokia phones , its a 1 , compared to other blunders by other companies (such a samsung and motorrola) it might be good .... but if you're getting a Nokia , don't get this one .[Nokia 6600]	phone[+3][u]	I never had a single problem.[Nokia 6600]	menu[+3]	It is Nokia and thus easy to acces the menu options.[Nokia 6600]	video[+3],pictures[+3]	High quality video and pictures rock![Nokia 6600]	band[+3]	3 band and you can just change the SIM card in it to be able to use it in Europe with another service provider.[Nokia 6600]	phone[+3]	Bottom line great phone for the time being.[Nokia 6600]	color TFT display[+3][u],camera[+3],video[+3]	I use a Nokia 6600, it has a great color TFT display and camera equipped with zoom, which complement a built-in video recorder with audio and a RealOne player for playback and streaming of 3GPP-compatible and RealMedia video clips.[Nokia 6600]	Multimedia functions[+3]	Multimedia functions are enhanced by multi-slide MMS messages and a Gallery for organizing digital content captured or downloaded with the phone.[Nokia 6600]	[s]	Yes, certainly.[Nokia 6600]	6600[+3]	The Nokia 6600 is a decent extension of the smartphone line.[Nokia 6600]	keypad[+3],display[+3][u],rundown time[+3][u],software[+3]	The phone has such advantages as the excellent keypad and display, long rundown time and a good software suite.[Nokia 6600]	MMC slot[-2],design[-2]	Among its weak points is the MMC slot location and a bit vague design.[Nokia 6600]	6600[+2]	In short, the Nokia 6600 is an evolution but not a revolution.[Nokia 6600]	multimedia[+3]	I'm sure you can read the specs above to see everything it does, but for me the best thing is that I can easily check my email, movie times, news, or any website with this phone.[Nokia 6600]	picture[+3]	You can take pic of your friends and the picture will pop up when they call.[Nokia 6600]	ringtone[+3]	Give each friend a different ringtone.[Nokia 6600]	rings[+3],themes[+3]	Get great themes and wallpapers for this phone and many many polyphonic rings.[Nokia 6600]	screen[+3]	A huge beautiful color screen which can not been scratched at all even with the rough handling i give it.[Nokia 6600]	Nokia[+3],phones[+3]	Nokia makes great phones, and this one is the cream of the crop.[Nokia 6600]	phone[+3]	Best phone i've ever owned, period.[Nokia 6600]	phone[+3][p]	Frankly, I think this is one of the niftiest pieces of hardware I've ever used.[Nokia 6600]	speed[+2]	It is slow to initially start up, but once it's turned on, I've never had any complaints about the speed.[Nokia 6600]	phone[+3][u]	Everything, so far, has worked flawlessly.[Nokia 6600]	phone[+3][u]	All at the same time, and all without a hitch.[Nokia 6600]	interface[+3]	I think the interface is great.[Nokia 6600]	6600[+3][cc]	I actually purchased two phones recently (this one at the new Blackberry phone), and this one is far superior (IMHO).[Nokia 6600]	features[+3],interface[+3],size[+3],camera[+3],internet connectivity[+3],quality[+3]	I love the features, the interface, the size (the screen is a delight), the camera (though I admit I'm not much of a camera user -- so just a toy for me), the internet connectivity, the quality, etc.[Nokia 6600]	phone[+3]	If I had to do it over, I wouldn't buy anything else.[Nokia 6600]	signal[+3][u][cc]	UPSIDE: This one, like most Nokias, receives a consistently strong signal (I've tried some Samsung and Sony Ericsson models which were very weak on the reception front).[Nokia 6600]	Bluetooth[+3]	I love the Bluetooth; easy to use with a wireless Jabra headset.[Nokia 6600]	Photos[+3]	Photos are pretty darned good![Nokia 6600]	speed[-3][u]	DOWNSIDE: It takes a long time to start up.[Nokia 6600]	speed[-3][u][cs]	My last simpler Nokia started right up and was immediately ready for use.[Nokia 6600]	movies[-3][u]	The "movies" last about 5 seconds.[Nokia 6600]	movies[-3][u]	I mean, they're short![Nokia 6600]	feature[-3]	I find this feature on this phone useless, but, since I don't really need this function anyway, I don't really use it.[Nokia 6600]	navigatee[-3]	Also, when I dial an "800" number like an airline, it will not allow me to use number keys to navigatee the prerecorded menu.[Nokia 6600]	screen[-3]	Finally, after about a week's use, the screen started to freeze on me.[Nokia 6600]	calls[-3][p]	It would not hang up on calls.[Nokia 6600]	screen[-3][p]	Once it froze so bad I couldn't even use the power button to turn it off, and had to open and take out the battery.[Nokia 6600]	phone[+2]	Probably a great phone overall, and perhaps mine just has bugs.[Nokia 6600]	user-interfaces[+3],bluetooth[+3],applications[+3],6600[+3]	With one of the most intuitive user-interfaces around, seamless bluetooth sync with Microsoft Outlook, support for thousands of applications for the Symbian platform which this phone runs on (I own the IR Remote, ICQ and a few others), the Nokia 6600 is all of the above - one of the few phones from T-Mobile that can claim such a distinction.[Nokia 6600]	phone[+3]	Ive had this phone for a year now - and its the best phone I have owned.[Nokia 6600]	camera[-2]	The only con I can think of is the lack of a mega-pixel camera.[Nokia 6600]	[s]	But if you are one of the customers contributing to this, its a big mistake.[Nokia 6600]	[s]	So if you order one of the top 10 bestselling phones from Amazon now, it will take at least 3 weeks for your shipment to be delivered...guess Amazon is waiting for seconds to re-package,[Nokia 6600]	phone[+2]	This may be a really cool phone, but it's not worth it with T-Mobile.[Nokia 6600]	service[-3][p]	They have the worst service of any of the major companies.[Nokia 6600]	T-Mobile[-3]	I really regret signing up with T-Mobile, but I'm stuck with them for the next 6 months of the contract.[Nokia 6600]	[s]	If you're looking for a new company, don't be fooled by the service plans.[Nokia 6600]	phone[+3]	This phone is fantastic.[Nokia 6600]	reception[+3],visibility[+3],interface[+3]	Great reception, visibility and interface (may be complicated by others).[Nokia 6600]	rebate[-3]	Just don't get drawn into T-Mobile's catchy rebate.[Nokia 6600]	rebate[-3]	T-Mobile wasn't upfront about some of the terms to qualify for the rebate.[Nokia 6600]	phone[+3]	I highly recommend this phone.[Nokia 6600]	Sony ericsson T610[+3][cc]	I had a Sony ericsson T610 before this and the T610 is far inferior.[Nokia 6600]	back cover[-2], battery life[+3]	I find it difficult to remove back cover so is you plan to have a spare battery and replace it I suggest you don't ,besides it has a long battery life.[Nokia 6600]	battery life[+3][u]	Im able to keep my phone on for about a week (mostly stand by) to three days (regular use)[Nokia 6600]	phone[+3]	but this by far is the best phone out there right now![Nokia 6600]	large[-1][u],screen[+3]	yes it is a bit large, but the realestate on the screen will spoil you![Nokia 6600]	screens[+3][cc]	i have a hard time using other phones with smaller screens!!![Nokia 6600]	OS[-1]	the OS is abit confusing at 1st, but within a few days you will pass this learning curve![Nokia 6600]	pics[+3]	the pics can be touched up in photoshop, and be printed at 4x6 and they look great![Nokia 6600]	bluetooth[+3]	i also use the phone as my modem via bluetooth to my Apple powerbook![Nokia 6600]	bluetooth[+3][u]	The speed is the same as dail up, where i live we do not have wifi everywhere so this is my version of it until we catch up.[Nokia 6600]	[s]	i would highly recommmend...... oh and i have owned this baby for like 6 months now[Nokia 6600]	phone[+3]	The phone itself is pretty nice.[Nokia 6600]	Camera quality[+2]	Camera quality isn't bad for the low resolution.[Nokia 6600]	Menu[-1][u],phone[+3][u]	Menu is a bit slow, but overall, phone is very functional.[Nokia 6600]	features[+3]	This phone has a nice blend of features without going overboard.[Nokia 6600]	Motorola T720i[-3][cc],calls[-3][cc],syncing data[-3][cc]	I was using a Motorola T720i with Verizon and I had alot of dropped calls and I had troubles syncing data.[Nokia 6600]	Bluetooth[+3],battery life[+3],reception[+3],screen[+3]	I was looking for a phone which synced with Mac OSX using Bluetooth, had decent battery life, could check email, had good reception, nice screen size and was durable (I break often break small gadgets)[Nokia 6600]	interface[+3]	The interface is simple to use.[Nokia 6600]	menus[-2],menu[-2],load time[-2]	I saw a few complaints on the load time of menus and I feel people are over-exaggerating the menu load time.[Nokia 6600]	menu[+2][u]	I have a couple hundred contacts and the menu loads within a few seconds, no big deal.[Nokia 6600]	menus[+2][u]	I did notice if you turn the phone on and off the OS takes a bit to load up and initially the menus are slower but once the phone has been on and booted up the menus are reasonably quicker.[Nokia 6600]	camera[+2]	The camera is adequate and if I want high-res photos I'll use my digital camera instead.[Nokia 6600]	T-Mobile service[+3]	On the T-Mobile service I was able to take pics as we drove across I-70 and email them to family & friends once we reached a T-Mobile tzone (usually a major city).[Nokia 6600]	T-Mobile service[+3]	Outside of the T-Mobile service area the phone seamlessly jumped onto AT&T Wireless and various other services where the T-Mobile service was unavailable.[Nokia 6600]	reception[+3]	As I drove across the country I lost reception only in eastern Kentucky's mountains.[Nokia 6600]	6600[+3][cs],battery life[+3],connectivity bars[+3],features[+3]	Along the way we compared it to my wife's T720i and the 6600 was superior in terms of battery life, connectivity bars and features.[Nokia 6600]	iSync[+3][u]	For those Mac OSX users out there, iSync works fairly well.[Nokia 6600]	Bluetooth[-1]	On occasion I'm not able to connect to the phone with iSync via Bluetooth but I found that rebooting the phone seems to solve this problem.[Nokia 6600]	Bluetooth[+2],battery[+2]	And Bluetooth does not drain the battery as quick as I thought it would, I usually can go 1.5 days with Bluetooth on along with making calls before I need a full recharge.[Nokia 6600]	battery[+2]	With Bluetooth off the phone last almost twice as long.[Nokia 6600]	phone[+3]	The nokia 6600 is a great phone, good games, good camera.[Nokia 6600]	video recorders[-1]	The video recorders a bit odd, sometimes I get 9 secs on my recordings, sometimes I get 17.[Nokia 6600]	voice recorders[+2]	The voice recorders good, but you can't record songs off the radio for ring tones.[Nokia 6600]	games[+1]	The games are decent, but u only get 2 to start off with.[Nokia 6600]	games[+3]	But you can download some really good ones like pac-man or mafia wars.[Nokia 6600]	phones[+3]	Overall the phones fantastic, and I would have given it 5 stars, but its not perfect.[Nokia 6600]	[s]	If your looking for a phone thats mainly for calls and killing time this is the one you want.[Nokia 6600]	battery[+3]	The battery on mine lasts 2 days if I don't play games that much, and it only takes 90 mins to charge from flat.[Nokia 6600]	battery[+3]	This phone has the best battery, it lasts longer then my old 3210[Nokia 6600]	MMC[+3]	I got a 1GB MMC upgrade for this phone and now I can:[Nokia 6600]	video[+3]	1. Record around 1 hour of video with Phillips Camcorder Pro.[Nokia 6600]	pictures[+3]	2. Take around 10,000 640x480 pictures.[Nokia 6600]	games[+3]	3. Play Java games on it.[Nokia 6600]	games[+3]	4. Play N-Gage games on it.[Nokia 6600]	internet[+3]	5. Check traffic411.com for LA traffic on the 405.[Nokia 6600]	games[+3]	6. Play Gameboy Color games on it with GoBoy.[Nokia 6600]	speaker phone[+2]	7. Have a good chunk of my small MP3 to listen through the speaker phone.[Nokia 6600]	bluetooth[+3]	8. Connected the phone to my tablet pc and now can access company VPN at 56k speed via bluetooth.[Nokia 6600]	call logs[+1]	Clear the call logs once in a while to speed up the phone people!!![Nokia 6600]	bluetooth[+2]	As for bluetooth, no problems at all.[Nokia 6600]	bluetooth[+2]	I've connected the phone with two laptops and a iPaq 4155.[Nokia 6600]	bluetooth[+2]	Very simple and painless.[Nokia 6600]	phone[+3]	This is the first cell phone I've owned, and overall, I am quite pleased with it.[Nokia 6600]	[cs]	I purchased this phone after researching many different phones, mostly Nokia's that were T-Mobile compatiable.[Nokia 6600]	phone[+2]	Among my requirments for a phone were: good screen, decent camera, bluetooth, and GPRS support.[Nokia 6600]	6600[+3],phone[+3]	The 6600 was the best phone I could find with these options that I could get with t-mobile.[Nokia 6600]	internet[+1]	One primary reason for getting a cell phone was so that I could use it as an internet connection for my laptop running linux, where softmodem drivers are hard to find, and don't work very well.[Nokia 6600]	GPRS[+2]	If you are using Linux, and you want to use GPRS to connect to the net, I suggest this phone along with a Belkin USB Bluetooth adapter.[Nokia 6600]	camera[+3]	I have really enjoyed the camera on this phone.[Nokia 6600]	images[-1],camera[+2]	Although the images are not the best in the world, its very handy to have a camera everywhere you go.[Nokia 6600]	feature[+2]	And the phone has a very cool feature wich allows you to send images via a normal POP3/SMTP e-mail account.[Nokia 6600]	e-mail[+3]	I will also say that setting up the e-mail account was very simple and straight-forward, although you do need an external SMTP server to use.[Nokia 6600]	ringtone[+2]	The phone can use any MIDI audio file as a ringtone.[Nokia 6600]	ringtone[+3],music[+3]	Which is really nice because you can get pretty much any piece of music in MIDI format for free on the net.[Nokia 6600]	bluetooth[+1]	You can use the OBEX File Transfer service with bluetooth from linux (KDE-bluetooth provieds a nice intergration into Konqueror for this) for sending files to the phone.[Nokia 6600]	ringtones[+2]	The fact that you can assign ringtones to people and/or groups is really cool.[Nokia 6600]	OS[-1]	I will say that the OS that the phone runs does have a few issues.[Nokia 6600]	applications[-2]	Sometimes, various applications crash.[Nokia 6600]	bluetooth[-2]	Especially the bluetooth server... Meaning you have to restart the phone if you want bluetooth to work again.[Nokia 6600]	bluetooth[-2]	This is somewhat annoying, but from working with computers (espcially windows -- ugh...)[Nokia 6600]	Freespeak[+2]	I really dislike holding a phone to my ear, and I've found the Freespeak to be very comfortable and easy to use with this phone.[Nokia 6600]	voice-dialing system[-2]	The only main drawback is the fact that the voice-dialing system is kinda picky.[Nokia 6600]	voice-dialing system[-1][p]	It takes a while to learn how to use it right, and at this point I am able to make about 70% of my calls using it.[Nokia 6600]	voice-dialing system[-2][p]	However, it needs to be quite quiet for it to work at all -- dosn't work at all in the car, for example.[Nokia 6600]	size[-1],weight[-1]	Some people have commented about the size and weight of the phone, and it has rightfully gotten the nick-name "the bar of soap" which, it really is.[Nokia 6600]	size[+1],weight[+1]	But if you use all bluetooth accessories, as I do, its really not an issue.[Nokia 6600]	phone[+3]	All in all, this is a great phone.[Nokia 6600]	price[+3]	Especially for the price amazon gives it at (I was unable to get mine through amazon due to some credit complications).[Nokia 6600]	phone[+3]	If you use linux and want GRPS and/or want to use a handsfree bluetooth device, and want a decent camera -- this is the phone for you.[Nokia 6600]	phone[+3]	I really love this phone...[Nokia 6600]	T-Mobile[+3],ATT[-3]	I also am loving T-Mobile (100 times better than ATT...[Nokia 6600]	T-Mobile[+3]	you actually can talk to a real person for support in under an hour!).[Nokia 6600]	6600[+2][u],T-Mobile[+2]	Have had the Nokia 6600 for a year now and am generally very happy with it and with T-Mobile.[Nokia 6600]	features[+2]	It offers way more features than I need but the ones I use work well.[Nokia 6600]	signal[+3]	I almost always get a good strong signal, even in fairly remote areas here in the southwest.[Nokia 6600]	sound[+3],speaker phone[+3]	The sound quality is excellent and the speaker phone couldn't be easier to use.[Nokia 6600]	size[+2],shape[+2]	I like the size and shape.[Nokia 6600]	size[+3],shape[+3]	It fits comfortably in my hand and pocket.[Nokia 6600]	keys[-1]	The only problem is the size of the keys.[Nokia 6600]	key[-1][u]	My fingers are kind of stubby so it took a while to learn how to hit a key without hitting the adjacent ones.[Nokia 6600]	kays[-2][u]	They really are awfully small.[Nokia 6600]	battery life[-1]	Also the battery life isn't great but it's sufficient for my needs.[Nokia 6600]	calls[+1]	It also works just fine for international calls.[Nokia 6600]	instant messaging[+2]	It's a bit pricey to call home from other countries but the instant messaging to and from covered countries in Europe are quite reasonable.[Nokia 6600]	quality[+3]	It's really well made and has survived sliding across floors and pavement without a scratch.[Nokia 6600]	T-Mobile[+3]	I've had nothing but good luck with T-Mobile.[Nokia 6600]	customer service agents[+3],service[+3]	Their customer service agents are always prompt and polite and my service is terrific.[Nokia 6600]	calls[+3]	I never get dropped calls.[Nokia 6600]	T-Mobile[+3],Verizon[-1],Quest Wireless[-3]	It seems to be a much more user friendly company than Verizon and a thousand percent better than the horrible Quest Wireless.[Nokia 6600]	T-Mobile[+3][s],6600[+3][s]	I recommend T-Mobile and the Nokia 6600 without reservation.[Nokia 6600]	6600[+3][cs],3650[-2]	The Nokia 6600 is really just a glorified 3650: you know the 3650, those bulbous, formless, big phones a few unfortunate ATT customers are carrying around.[Nokia 6600]	OS[+2]	The Nokia 660 runs the Symbian OS, which works pretty well for most standard phone fare, most of the stuff is not that intuitive, but if you actually learn how to use it all, there's plenty of neat tie-ins.[Nokia 6600]	phone[+3],use[+3]	I've had this phone for almost a year now and it has been nothing but great to use.[Nokia 6600]	bluetooth[+2]	I can connect to my computer via bluetooth to transfer images, calender events, contacts and anything else.[Nokia 6600]	ringers[+3]	Another great feature for me anyway is the ability to load .wav sounds as ringers.[Nokia 6600]	ringtones[+3]	This way I never have to be ripped off by the carrier for stupid ringtones, I can get whatever I want.[Nokia 6600]	slow[-1]	The only downside I have found with this phone is that it is a bit slow to react, meaning when I push the contacts button, it takes a while to load, this is true for almost all the menus and programs on the phone.[Nokia 6600]	OS[+3]	Other than that, the simbian series 60 OS is great and offers lots of proprietary software that will work on your phone if you're willing to hunt for it.[Nokia 6600]	Hand set[+1],rebate[-1]	Hand set is good, but be aware of this T-MOBILE rebate.[Nokia 6600]	rebate[-1]	These people takes lest effort to process rebate forms.[Nokia 6600]	rebate[-2]	For last one month my Rebate status showing me that my rebate is apporved and check is delivered but still I am waiting for Check.[Nokia 6600]	customer care[-2]	There is no way you can talk with customer care about this.[Nokia 6600]	rebates[-2]	Dont rely on T-Mobile rebates.[Nokia 6600]	features[+2],speaker phone[+1],web browser[+1],camera[+1]	Initially these phones were fun to play with some of the cool features like the speaker phone, web browser and ofcourse the built in camera.[Nokia 6600]	screen[+2],display[+2]	The good:  1) Large LCD screen, colorful display, good resolution.[Nokia 6600]	features[+3],web browser[+1],camera[+1],video recorder[+1], speaker phone[+1],reception[+2]	2) Nice features, like web browser, camera, video recorder, speaker phone (very usefully), clear voice reception.[Nokia 6600]	Joy stick[+2],memory card[+2]	3) Joy stick for eazy navigation, 35Mb memory card to store the pictures and stuff.[Nokia 6600]	battery[-2]	Now the bad:  1) As usual, battery power not sufficient for daily usuage.[Nokia 6600]	Joy stick[+2],memory card[+2]	3) Joy stick for eazy navigation, 35Mb memory card to store the pictures and stuff.[Nokia 6600]	battery[-2]	The battery power discharges rapidly especially on using the web browser.[Nokia 6600]	slow[-3][u]	2) Phone is awfully slow.[Nokia 6600]	menu[-3][u]	Sometimes when you press buttons, the menu appears after a second or two.[Nokia 6600]	size[+1],heavy[-2][u]	3) Phone is kinda heavy, but small in size.[Nokia 6600]	Buttons[-2][u]	4) Buttons are quite small and is really a pain exp if one is fond of text messaging.[Nokia 6600]	Buttons[-2][u]	There will be much erasing of text as, one would tend to type something instead of the actual letters.[Nokia 6600]	video recorder[-2]	5) Video recorder is of no use and one cannot record something useful in 10 seconds and it takes a while to send the same through the "Free picture and video messaging" offered by service provider.[Nokia 6600]	Phone[+1]	The bottom line is "Phone is cool one - only for the moment, as its the latest phone in the market and has all the new features, but this will soon be displaced by upcoming newer phones".[Nokia 6600]	iSync compaibility[-2][u]	so, right out of the box i had issue.[Nokia 6600]	sync[-3]	namely, it wouldnt sync.[Nokia 6600]	iSync compaibility[-3][u]	after scouring the various boards i find this is an arbitrary and pervasive problem.[Nokia 6600]	nokia[-3]	but, i am quite unhappy with nokia at the moment.[Nokia 6600]	sonyericsson[+1]	if you are looking for a phone to integrate as easily as the sonyericsson phones with iSync, i say stick with a sonyericsson.[Nokia 6600]	phone[-3][p]	if there was a zero-star rating i would give it.[Nokia 6600]	phone[+1],reception[+2]	It is a multifunction phone, reception quality is better than the 610.[Nokia 6600]	speaker phone[+2],MMC card[+2]	speaker phone quality is good, and poping in a 512mb MMC card, it rocks ![Nokia 6600]	MP3 player[+2],games[+2],application[+2]	putting in MP3 player, lots of games and application to download.[Nokia 6600]	size[-2]	DOwnside is the size of the phone, it is BIG for today's standard.[Nokia 6600]	battery life[-3]	and the battery life is bad ![Nokia 6600]	battery life[-3][u]	I could hardly use it without a recharge in 2 days![Nokia 6600]	battery life[-3][p]	a bit dissapoitnd on that![Nokia 6600]	GPRS[-3]	the GPRS web access is sloooooooooooooow![Nokia 6600]	phone[+1]	I got this phone yesterday and didn't find any problems with it yet.[Nokia 6600]	Picture[+1],video[+1]	Picture and video quality is ok.[Nokia 6600]	speaker phone[+2]	Love the speaker phone.[Nokia 6600]	MEMORY[+3]	INCREDIBLE MEMORY![Nokia 6600]	MMC card[+3]	Aside from a 6MB++ built-in phone memory, there's a 32MB MMC card that goes with it![Nokia 6600]	Picture[+3],video[+2]	Picture quality's great for still and video with sound.[Nokia 6600]	ringtone[+2]	you can record your voice and turn it into a ringtone.[Nokia 6600]	Sony T610[-1][cc]	you can't do that with a Sony T610 (which i traded for a 6600).[Nokia 6600]	T610[-1][cc]	T610 supports only midi files.[Nokia 6600]	N6600[+2]	N6600 supports midi, wav, amr, mp3 etc.[Nokia 6600]	N6600[+2]	it has a handsfree loudspeaker, conference and transfer![Nokia 6600]	phone[+3]	I love this phone.[Nokia 6600]	phone[+3]	This phone is one of the milestones in the history of the cellular phones.[Nokia 6600]	OS[+2]	Supporting an operating system, Symbian OS, you can download and run a lot of programs on this phone.[Nokia 6600]	phone[+3],size[+3]	You can turn this phone into a gaming machine, a camcorder or a digital camera, an mp3-player, a movie viewer, a voice recorder, a personal secretary, a GPS map browser, a book, a multifunction remote controller, practically everything that you can do with the computer, plus it is a phone(!!) and also you can carry it in your pocket :).[Nokia 6600]	programs[+2][u]	Many of these programs are shareware, some can be purchased by paying a little bit of bucks.[Nokia 6600]	MMC memory[+3]	It uses the extendable MMC memory, it is perfect for storing videos, pictures and mp3s.[Nokia 6600]	look[+2]	Its nice look is also a plus.[Nokia 6600]	SIM-card[+2]	And also, since it is tri band and since it uses SIM-card, you can just use it in Europe and many other parts of the world, wherever GSM exists.[Nokia 6600]	phone[+3]	I am just in love with this phone, especially after using a more primitve phone about 3 years.[Canon S100]	small[+1]	I want to start off saying that this camera is small for a reason.[Canon S100]	camera[+3],size[+2]	I'm in high school, and this camera is perfect for what I use it for, carrying it around in my pocket so I can take pictures whenever I want to, of my friends and of funny things that happen.[Canon S100]	memory[-2]	The only thing I don't like is the small size (8 MEG) memory card that comes with it.[Canon S100]	room[-2]	I have to move pictures off of it every day so I have room for more pictures the next, and I don't have enough money to buy the 256 MEG card that I've had my eye on for a while.[Canon S100]	memory[-1][s],battery[-1]	A larger memory card and extra battery are good things to buy.[Canon S100]	pictures[-2]	Other than that pictures taken in the dark are not as nice as I'd like them,[Canon S100]	camera[+3]	I'd say that this camera is perfect.[Canon S100]	compact[+2]	OK, not quite everything...but this camera is so compact that you will have it by your side when you need it.[Canon S100]	size[+2]	I bought this camera for the same reason many of you are considering it, or have already bought it--it's size.[Canon S100]	small[+3]	It is amazingly small, it's hard to believe all that has been packed into this camera.[Canon S100]	small[+3],durable[+2]	it is so small that I am able to keep it in my pocket, and I don't have to fear that it will get ruined in my pocket because it is so durable.[Canon S100]	covering[+2]	There is also a small covering for the lens, so you need not worry that the lens will get scratched.[Canon S100]	picture[+3],small[+2]	The picture quality surprised me, when I first saw this camera I saw how small it was an instantly assumed that the picture quality would not be good--but I was wrong![Canon S100]	picture[+3]	The picture quality of this camera is outstanding (taking its' size and price into consideration).[Canon S100]	battery[-2]	First off, the battery.[Canon S100]	battery[-2]	This camera uses a lithium battery, I find lithium batteries to be highly inconvenient; because what if you are on vacation, where the nearest place to buy batteries is just a gas station--there is no way that you are going to find lithium batteries there.[Canon S100]	battery[-2]	Not only is it inconvenient, but also the battery life span is short.[Canon S100]	batteries[-1]	This isn't uncommon in cameras, though, just as long as you bring your charger and spare batteries, you should be fine.[Canon S100]	zoom[-2]	Another problem I had with this camera was the zoom function.[Canon S100]	zooms[-2]	Such a small zoom length that you would think that the zoom would be silent since it hardly zooms in...wrong![Canon S100]	zoom[-2]	The zoom function on this camera is so loud that sometimes you will be unable to use it if you find yourself in a situation where you must be quiet.[Canon S100]	start-up[-2]	Even just turning the camera on will move the lens a little, resulting in a noisy start-up.[Canon S100]	flash[-2]	The flash is very weak.[Canon S100]	macro[-2]	The last problem I found with this camera was the macro function.[Canon S100]	auto-focus[-2]	The auto-focus on the camera seems to have trouble focusing on the subject.[Canon S100]	work[-2]	To make matters work, there is no manual override to overcome this problem.[Canon S100]	focus[+2]	The focus is great, though, if you are not taking a macro shot.[Canon S100]	cameras[-1][cc]	it's not my first choice in cameras,[Canon S100]	size[+2]	I have come across many other beginner cameras that I prefer over this camera, but the thing you have to keep in mind about this camera is the size.[Canon S100]	camera[+2]	If you are just looking for something to keep with you at all times, then this is a great camera choice.[Canon S100]	s100[+2]	after considering my needs further and researching the marketplace, I decided on the s100.[Canon S100]	camera[+2]	It has given me zero problems, and the more I use it, the better I become at taking advantage of its strengths.[Canon S100]	small[-1]	1) It is perhaps too small. [Canon S100]	buttons[-2],read[-2]	I find it a bit difficult to manage the very tiny buttons and impossible to read the icons without my reading glasses on.[Canon S100]	size[-2]	Its size makes holding it steady for long a bit of a challenge (not enough camera body to grip with more than your finger tips).[Canon S100]	delay[-2],shots[-2]	2) The delay from the time you fully depress the shutter to the time the picture is taken is too long and may yield some fuzzy shots. [Canon S100]	autofocus[-2]	This is due to the unusually slow autofocus system.[Canon S100]	resolution setting[-1]	3) The lack of an intermediate resolution setting, as other reviewers have suggested, is a problem, but that problem is meaningless with a larger CompactFlash memory card[Canon S100]	hot[-2]	4) The camera gets really hot when you are busy snapping away.[Canon S100]	hot[-2]	It is hot enough to be annoying.[Canon S100]	small[+3],pictures[+3]	This wonderfully small digital camera produces fantastically good pictures printed on any decent photo-quality printer (with photo quality paper).[Canon S100]	snapshots[+1][cc]	It will not replace your high-end 35mm SLR but it's a great toy to keep near you at all times for snapshots.[Canon S100]	camera[+3]	This IS the best camera you can have for digital images if you want to:[Canon S100]	pictures[+2]	Take quick pictures with excelent resolution[Canon S100]	wait[+2]	Hate to wait between shots[Canon S100]	Download[+2]	Download it fast to your computer[Canon S100]	bundled software[+2]	Have a great and easy to use bundled software[Canon S100]	size[+2]	Travel with it without knowing you have it in your pocket[Canon S100]	Battery[+1]	FYI, Battery doesn't die if you don't use LCD[Canon S100]	color and light[+3]	The color and light I captured with this camera on a 12-day trip to Turkey (gorgeous vividly colored ceramic tiles inside darkened mosques) were far superior to anything I've ever gotten with a traditional 35-mm film camera.[Canon S100]	camera[+3]	I love this camera.[Canon S100]	camera[+1]	I don't believe this camera is still available. But if you can find one, you might like to get it.[Canon S100]	smallest[+3],best-built[+3]	It's still one of the smallest 2MP digital cameras on the market, and absolutely one of the best-built most stylish cameras ever.[Canon S100]	purchase[+2]	I am very pleased with my purchase.[Canon S100]	camera[+3]	I've been incredibly happy with this camera.[Canon S100]	camera[+2][cc]	This camera is great if you're used to a high-end SLR.[Canon S100]	snapshots[+1][cc]	It's overkill for simple snapshots, unless you've got way too much money to blow.[Canon S100]	Exposure[+1]	Exposure compensation in 1/3 stop increments (I leave it set on +1/3 stop to brighten up the default exposure, which goes a bit dark for my taste).[Canon S100]	flash[+2], mode[+2]	Slow-syncro flash, macro/infinity mode, etc.[Canon S100]	zoom range[-1],small[+2]	The zoom range is a little narrow (35-70mm in 35mm film equivalent), but given that the camera is the same as my wallet, I can't think of any real complaint.[Canon S100]	body[+2]	The SS body is wonderful, feels high-quality.[Canon S100]	body[+2][cs]	It's the same body as the popular ELP2 APS camera (take a look at a standard credit card from your wallet and you'll have an idea of the front profile!).[Canon S100]	lcd[-3]	I left the camera in my car in Maine (not a very hot place) and the LCD screen cracked ![Canon S100]	design[-2]	I then realized a major design flaw.[Canon S100]	functionality[-2]	All the camera's functionality is only available (or selectable) when the screen is functional.[Canon S100]	screen[-2]	When the screen stops working, you're out of luck ![Canon S100]	manual mode[+3]	I discovered that the camera has a manual mode that gives you total control over exposure, white balance, flash (red eye, person against bright background, flash on, flash off, flash automatic).[Canon S100]	viewfinder[-2]	The viewfinder does not accurately represent the pucture being taken.[Canon S100]	zoom[-3]	The digital zoom is crap.[Canon S100]	fits[+2]	It fits in your pocket.[Canon S100]	panorama setting[+3]	The panorama setting is unbelieveable ![Canon S100]	pictures[-1]	The pictures are a little dark sometimes.[Canon S100]	flash[+1]	You have the option to have the flash automatic or off.[Canon S100]	S100[+2]	The new Canon s300 is 33% larger and 26% heavier than the S100.[Canon S100]	movie mode[-1]	The movie mode can only record a max of 30 seconds at 160X120 per clip and a max of 4 seconds at 640X480.[Canon S100]	mode[+2][cs]	It has one more resolution of 1024X768 and a "Normal" compression mode.  And, it has the 3X zoom.[Canon S100]	price[-1][cs]	The price is $... more.[Canon S100]	software[-3]	I originally gave this camera 5 stars. When I had Windows 98 it was wonderful but I got a new computer last November with XP the usb software is Sooo... not compatible with XP[Canon S100]	drivers[-1]	The new drivers on cannon's site do not help at all but try them if you want they have made me have to use the backup software.[Canon S100]	software[-2]	The Adobe software also was wonderful in 98 but it will not let you print correctly with XP so you are forced to create your document then either print it from Windows or export it to another application.[Canon S100]	pictures[+3]	But it takes gorgeous pictures for a 2.1 MP camera.[Canon S100]	camera[+3]	I love this camera![Canon S100]	memory[-2][s]	 the only thing I don't like about it is that You have to buy a larger memory card, first thing![Canon S100]	price[+3]	I got this camera for an unbelievably low price at amazon.[Canon S100]	camera[+3]	I would recommend this camera unequivocally![Canon S100]	camera[+3]	I got this camera for an unbelievably low price at amazon.[Canon S100]	camera[+3]	I would recommend this camera unequivocally![Canon S100]	battery[+2]	But this DOES work even if you turn off the LCD viewing -- great  battery saver.[Canon S100]	camera[+2]	A great camera, but here are some points which I don't notice in most of the reviews here, which may be of concern especially to the more advanced amatuer:[Canon S100]	Elph s100[+2]	I purchased the Elph s100 mainly because I thought it was cool.[Canon S100]	exposure[+2],prints[+2][cc]	The camera does a great job with exposure and prints made with my professional printer looks great (not as good as prints from my pro digital camera, but still VERY good).[Canon S100]	smaller[+1],resolution[+1]	But I was ready to upgrade and when I discovered that Canon  was going to come out with an even smaller digital camera with a higher  resolution, I had to have the S100.[Canon S100]	S100[+3][cc]	This is my second digital camera, but I'm much more impressed with the Canon S100 Digital Elph than I EVER was with my Kodak DC240.[Canon S100]	light[+3][u],tiny[+3][u]	This camera is so light and tiny that I literally carry it everywhere with me, which is great considering I'm an artist and like to capture interesting items for future painting.[Canon S100]	software[+2]	The software that comes with the Digital Elph is very nice and intuitive.[Canon S100]	software[+2]	The PhotoStitch software is very cool if you want to do any 360 degree panorama shots.[Canon S100]	on-camera controls[-1]	My only complaint and the reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that the on-camera controls aren't as intuitive as they should be.[Canon S100]	work[-1][u]	I've often struggled to get something to work the way I want it, and hate to have to carry the manual with me all the time![Canon S100]	camera[+2]	Other than that, I love this camera.[Canon S100]	pictures[+3],color rendering[+3]	The pictures are uniformly excellent and color rendering is perfect.[Canon S100]	size[+2],metal case[+1],use[+2],picture quality[+1],software[+2]	The good:  Small size; durable-seeming metal case; easy to use; visually distinctive; good picture quality; fast USB connection; mostly intuitive operation; really cool PhotoStitch software that knits pictures together to give wide panoramas.[Canon S100]	size[+3],S100[+1]	If compact size is your highest priority in a 2-megapixel camera, the Canon PowerShot S100 Digital Elph is a standout choice and aptly named for its diminutive design.[Canon S100]	image quality[+1],weighs[+2]	The S100's image quality rates in the middle of its class, but it can still be a reasonable choice for students, families, or small businesses looking for an ultra-portable camera that weighs less than half a pound with media and battery pack.[Canon S100]	camera[+3]	I purchased this camera before it went on sale, and while I wouldn't have minded keeping the extra $$$, it was definitely worth it.[Canon S100]	product[+3]	I have been absolutely, completely satisfied with the product and its capabilities.[Canon S100]	product[+3]	This is a great product, and Canon has done an excellent job.[Canon S100]	jewel[+3][u]	I received this little jewel as a gift and I can honestly say Iabsolutely love it.[Canon S100]	usability[+2],performance[+2],expandability[+2],looks[+3]	I give this product five stars for its usability,performance, expandability, and definitely looks![Canon S100]	camera[+2],software[+2]	First, I have to say that I have NEVER had the slightest problem with this camera or the software.[Canon S100]	software[+2]	The software has been installed on Windows 95, 98, 2000 and XP and I haven't had any problems with it.[Canon S100]	camera[+1],performs[+1],picture[+2],battery[+1]	The camera is solid, performs well, takes good pictures, and the battery lasts pretty long if you disable the LCD viewfinder.[Canon S100]	pictures[-1]	All that said, I am a little disappointed with the quality of the pictures from the camera.[Canon S100]	sharp[+3],color balance[+3],focus[+2]	They are razor sharp, the color balance is perfect, and the focus is great.[Canon S100]	pictures of people[-3]	When taking pictures of people, however, it shows EVERY flaw in the subject's skin.[Canon S100]	pics[-2][cc]	Other cameras taking pics of the same subjects turn out looking much better.[Canon S100]	processing[-1]	I will also say that it takes a very long moment for the camera to do its digital image processing between the time you press the button and when the camera actually takes the picture.[Canon S100]	camera[+3]	I must say, I think this is the coolest camera I've ever  owned![Canon S100]	size[+3]	First, it really is tiny; the size of a pack of cigarettes, maybe  a scooch deeper.[Canon S100]	use[+3]	Second, it is  incredibly easy to use.[Canon S100]	photos[+2]	I just went on a quick photo shoot in NYC's  Central Park today, and what a bunch of beautiful photos I took, if I do  say so myself (and I do!)[Canon S100]	use[+2][cc]	The camera is as easy to use as a point and  shoot, and with instant review on the LCD screen, you can retake any  flubbed shots on the spot.[Canon S100]	optical zoom[+2],cap[+1]	The two-times optical zoom operates smoothly  and quietly, and lo and behold, a two-piece shutter-like cap automatically  slides closed over the lens when you turn the camera off.[Canon S100]	software[+2]	I also had no  problems installing or running the camera software on my PC.[Canon S100]	S100[+2]	At any rate, if you have been interested in  digital photography but the price and confusion have held you back,  consider the Canon S100 Digital Elph.[Canon S100]	camera[+2]	It really is the perfect travel  camera, plus it offers the convenience of digital photography.[Canon S100]	use[+2],images[+2],fits[+1][u]	Really like it, easy to use, great images, very intuitive, fits in my jacket pocket.[Canon S100]	compact[+1][u],rugged[+1],use[+1]	I was looking for a compact, rugged (I carry it hiking, skiing, boating, etc) camera which is easy to use.[Canon S100]	memory expansion[+1],macro mode[+1],housing[+1]	I wanted standard memory expansion (CF cards), macro mode, and if possible, a waterproof housing (for kayaking).[Canon S100]	small[+2]	Even with the waterproof housing it is small.[Canon S100]	lens[+1]	The lens retracts and has its own metal cover so you don't need to fuss with a lens cap.[Canon S100]	housing[+1]	The metal housing seems very rugged.[Canon S100]	automatic modes[-1]	I'd give it  5 stars if the automatic modes were better and if there were true manual focus and exposure modes.[Canon S100]	auto mode[-1]	For example, in auto mode you can't use the flash redeye reduction, you must be in manual mode for that.[Canon S100]	auto color balance[-1]	The auto color balance is often fooled by dense clouds.[Canon S100]	dynamic range[-1][cc]	The dynamic range seems not quite as good as the Kodak DC260.[Canon S100]	macro mode[+1]	The macro mode works well, although it takes some practice since the camera doesn't clearly indicate when it can't focus.[Canon S100]	LCD[+1]	The white-LED backlit LCD is very bright and crisp, even in sunlight, and relatively easy on the battery.[Canon S100]	panorama modes[+2]	The panorama modes are wonderful.[Canon S100]	small[+3][u],light[+3][u]	It's so small and light, even with a spare battery, you really can take it anywhere.[Canon S100]	auto mode[+1]	In auto mode anyone can use it as a point and shoot camera.[Canon S100]	manual modes[+1]	The manual modes give you a lot of control over exposure and white balance (but there is no manual focus or manual exposure).[Canon S100]	light[+1],compact[+1]	There are better cameras but none anywhere near as light and compact.[Canon S100]	Small[+1]	1- Small.[Canon S100]	smal[+2]	VERY smal.[Canon S100]	cameras[+2][cc]	I've had a lot of cameras, but this one is ACTUALLY being used, and not stored in a desk: it's allways in my shist pocket.[Canon S100]	picture quality[+3],use[+2][u]	2- Excellent picture quality and so simple to use!!![Canon S100]	Looks[+1][u]	4- Looks great.[Canon S100]	case[+1]	Silver metal case -NOT PLASTIC.[Canon S100]	software[+3]	5- Excelent software package.[Canon S100]	TFT screen[+1]	6- Small but very clear TFT screen.[Canon S100]	TFT[+1]	Don't care about sunlight: it's TFT.[Canon S100]	panorama mode[+2]	7- 360 panoramic pictures are a very big deal.[Canon S100]	buttons[-1]	8- Buttons are little, but If you have steady fingers and dealed with a casio wirst calculator watch, you can deal with almost anything.[Canon S100]	buttons[-1]	Buttons size is OK for me, my wife, but not my grany.[Canon S100]	canon s100[1][cc]	i researched and researched between getting the canon s20 or the canon s100, and of course i got the latter![Canon S100]	ease of use[+2][u],picture detail[+2][u]	I was looking for something that wasn't too complicated to use and to help the pics I post on Ebay show more detial.[Canon S100]	size[+3][u],casing[+2]	This camera is great, wonderfully small, and has attactive hi-tech casing.[Canon S100]	ease of use[+3]	Very easy to use for someone like me who's just hopping on the digital camera bandwagon.[Canon S100]	controls[+2],ease of use[+2][u]	The controls are easy to understand and big enough that they are easy to see and use.[Canon S100]	zoom[+1]	The optical and digital zooms combine to give an effective 4x zoom.[Canon S100]	capacity[+2]	This is enough capacity and capability to do a complete household inventory, for example.[Canon S100]	size[+1][u],pictures[+2]	After getting one for Christmas from Amazon, I'm now a believer:  The Digital Elph is truly the world's smallest digital camera that shoots great pictures.[Canon S100]	pictures[+2]	I've had this camera just over 2 years and it takes pretty good pictures.[Canon S100]	size[+3]	The size is tiny, which I love.[Canon S100]	pictures[-1]	Sometimes the pictures are onthe dark side, but I'm able to fix that using the Photoshop 6.0 "adjust levels" function ... not sure how a person would do that without Photoshop, though.[Canon S100]	ease of use[+3][u]	This camera is so easy to use![Canon S100]	features[+3]	All the features are incredibly intuitive, even for a novice like me.[Canon S100]	pictures[+3],size[+3]	The pictures are beautiful, and the camera is so small you can carry it anywhere.[Canon S100]	price[+2],features[+2],size[+2],ease of use[+2]	I, as many others, have waited for many years for the convergence of price, features, size and ease of use to hit that happy center point.[Canon S100]	fun[+3]	I bought this little guy a few weeks back, and I have to saythat I never had so much fun with a new toy as this.[Canon S100]	size[+3]	You willdefinitly appreciate the small size.[Linksys Router]	router[+2]	This router does everything that it is supposed to do, so i dont really know how to talk that bad about it. [Linksys Router]	setup[+2], installation[+2]	It was a very quick setup and installation, in fact the disc that it comes with pretty much makes sure you cant mess it up. [Linksys Router]	install[+3]	By no means do you have to be a tech junkie to be able to install it, just be able to put a CD in the computer and it tells you what to do. [Linksys Router]	works[+3]	It works great, i am usually at the full 54 mbps, although every now and then that drops to around 36 mbps only because i am 2 floors below where the router is. [Linksys Router]	router[+2][p]	It really is a great buy if you are lookin at having just one modem but many computers around the house. [Linksys Router]	router[+2]	There are 3 computers in my house all getting wireless connection from this router, and everybody is happy with it. [Linksys Router]	setup[+2], ROUTER[+][s]	Its the easiest thing to setup i thought, and i am only 16...So with all that said, BUY THE ROUTER!!!!     [Linksys Router]	install[-2], router[+1]	It's probably a fine router, but I found the install wizard to be of poor quality.  [Linksys Router]	Wizard[-2][u]	The Wizard is particularly sinister. [Linksys Router]	wizard[-2]	It just tells you to start disconnecting and attaching cables without any input as to whether your current setup includes a pre-existing router (mine does), without any clarity as to whether you should be running the wizard on a hard-wired PC or a wireless equipped PC. [Linksys Router]	setup[-2]	The box proudly displays "SecureEasySetup (TM)" "Wireless Made Simple" "One Touch Setup Button" "Easy Start" "Easy Security" "Easy Everyday"   Apparently Linksys/Cisco knows that ease of setup is crucial. [Linksys Router]	router[+2]	I recently bought the Linksys WRT54G router and have been very happy with the router itself. [Linksys Router]	configuration[-2][cc]	HOWEVER, configuration of my system and actual setup of the router for wireless use took me more than 3 hours, and briefly made me reconsider my choice to forego the airport and its notoriously easy setup. [Linksys Router]	CD[-1]	Too bad they don't mention anything about how the CD can't be used with a Mac. [Linksys Router]	user manual[-2]	I even downloaded the product's user manual - useless. [Linksys Router]	technical support[-2]	The Linksys technical support site has nothing about configuring the router for use with a Mac. [Linksys Router]	instruction[-2]	I say adequate because it was enough to get wireless working, but nowhere near enough instruction to do the proper configuration job that I could have done if so![Linksys Router]	documentation[-2]	What this product really needs is better documentation for how to set up the router for DIFFERENT OPERATING SYSTEMS![Linksys Router]	setup[-2]	* I'm giving it 4 stars because the setup process was so miserable. [Linksys Router]	product[+3][p]	But the product iself is great.  [Linksys Router]	router[+3][p]	Once you set it up, it's great. [Linksys Router]	well-priced[+2]	And it is EXTREMELY well-priced for what you're getting. [Linksys Router]	performance[+3][u]	Another 5 star performance. [Linksys Router]	CD[+3]	This setup using the CD was about as easy as learning how to open a refrigerator door for the first time. [Linksys Router]	speed[+3]	Pertaining to the speed issue: I got 54Mps while I was in the same room. [Linksys Router]	works[+3]	This router works at 54Mbps that's megabyte not kilobyte. [Linksys Router]	running[+3]	I hooked the Linksys wireless router up to a broadband connection which is running at a maximum of 700 plus Kilobytes on the download e![Linksys Router]	Broadband[+3]	Broadband hooked up to this wireless setup flies. [Linksys Router]	Installation[+3]	Installation was as near automatic as can be. [Linksys Router]	equipment[+3]	All in all this is a 5 star piece of equipment. [Linksys Router]	WEP encryption[-1]	I had some issues when I had enabled WEP encryption and then moved on to WPA. [Linksys Router]	connectivity[+2]	Even during the firmware updates my roommates did not loose wireless connectivity.  [Linksys Router]	firmware update[+2]	New firmware update allows for automatic wireless network configuration. [Linksys Router]	configuration[+2]	All you have to do is click one button on the router configuration window and the router automatically senses the devices and configures the network. [Linksys Router]	router[+3][u]	Awesome for the newbie, though I personally like to fasten every bolt myself.  [Linksys Router]	installation[+2]	Comes with a installation CD which instructs you step by step to setting up the router. [Linksys Router]	setting up[+3]	You need to know absolutely nothing about setting up the network.  [Linksys Router]	costlier[-1][u]	Linksys is more costlier than others and is a home/consumer division of Cisco. [Linksys Router]	instructions[-2][u]	There were no other obvious setup instructions - though there was a softcopy manual, it did not give an answer readily on what do to.  [Linksys Router]	security[-2]	The only other problem was that security for the wireless connection.  [Linksys Router]	works[+2]	The router works fine for both wired and wireless.  [Linksys Router]	connect[+3][u]	I can go pretty far away from my router and still connect wirelessly.  [Linksys Router]	connect[+2][u]	Overall, if you know what basic steps to take, it was not difficult to connect, and the s/w worked well to connect.  [Linksys Router]	CD[-2][u]	little to no networking experience, just in case the automatic CD method has issues.  [Linksys Router]	router[+2][p]	I'd give it 4.5 stars if possible, but since 5 stars would be misleading, I give it 4 stars.     [Linksys Router]	enterprise piece[-3][u]	This is not an enterprise piece of hardware that you will find in an office or corporate environment. [Linksys Router]	router[+2][p]	I have had mine for about a year and use a third party firmware on mine and love it. [Linksys Router]	hardware version[-3][u]	The new hardware version does not run Linux at all and most likely will not since the memory has been cut in half. [Linksys Router]	WRT54G[+2][u]	just want a wireless router for home or your very small business, you can just get a WRT54G from here and configure it. [Linksys Router]	WRT54G[+3][u]	I would highly recommend that you do this if you want to learn something, but if you are not interested in learning this stuff and just want a working wireless router, just get the WRT54G.     [Linksys Router]	CD[-2]	I tried the CD setup program without any luck.  [Linksys Router]	1-800[+2][u]	Yes, the 1-800 number probably redirected me to someone in India, but the guy was easy to understand, and he helped solve the problem. [Linksys Router]	CD[-3]	Essentially, the CD included with the package is, for the most part, worthless.  [Linksys Router]	product[+2][p]	It'll make life a lot easier, and preclude you from having to give this product a negative review.  [Linksys Router]	router[+2]	This is my fourth Linksys product and, aside from the rough start, I'm very satisfied with this router.     [Linksys Router]	router[+3][p]	This linksys router does it for the RIGHT PRICE. [Linksys Router]	range[+3]	The range is terrific, I am using this for my home and I was transferring at 50+mbs from my backyard.[Linksys Router]	WRT54G[+3]	I've since gotten the Linksys Modem (BEFCMU10) and stacked it with the WRT54G router and it works fantastic!!! [Linksys Router]	set up[+2][u]	It took me about an hour to set up a wireless environment in her townhouse and she hasn't called me yet with any problems. [Linksys Router]	instructions[+2]	there are instructions to encrypt your personal wirless network so no one else can end up hogging/stealing your bandwidth. [Linksys Router]	installation[+3]	And the tech writers have made the installation process SO EASY for people lik my aunt to follow. [Linksys Router]	product[+3][u]	A very well made product that has worked very well for me over the years. [Linksys Router]	security[+2], speed[+2]	I upgraded from an older 801.11b router to the Linksys WRT54G for its improved security, and of course, speed. [Linksys Router]	router[-2][p]	However, this product performed well below my expectation.  [Linksys Router]	stream[-2], copy large files[-2][u]	The Achilles heel of this router is its inability to stream music, or copy large files over the local network.  [Linksys Router]	design[-2]	After some research on the Net, I discovered that there is indeed a flaw with the current WRT54G design (WRT54G, version 3, which Amazon currently sells).  [Linksys Router]	security[+2]	As I mentioned in my first paragraph, it supports WPA security, which is far superior to WEP.  [Linksys Router]	setup[+3]	In addition it is very easy to setup.  [Linksys Router]	use[+2], security[+2]	anted to rate the router higher than 1 star, due to its security, easy of use, etc.  [Linksys Router]	works[+3]	So far it all works fine with either cable or wireless connections.  [Linksys Router]	setup[+3]	The setup was very easy. [Linksys Router]	instructions[+2]	Just follow the instructions carefully, it's all based on a CD that has everything you need to get you up and running in no time. [Linksys Router]	design[+2], anteanna[+1]	The dual anteanna is a plus and the design is slick.   [Linksys Router]	signals[+3][u]	drops and strong signals even from the backyard. [Linksys Router]	security[+3], configuration menu[+3]	The WRT54G offers excellent security features and much more (and easier) configuration menu that I didn't even need a manual to setup correctly.  [Linksys Router]	Linksys[+2][u]	Even though you could get a cheap router these days, I'm happy I spent a little extra for the Linksys. [Linksys Router]	quality[+2]	The quality is significant and you'll be very happy from saving time and the headache.      [Linksys Router]	working[+2]	I got it working fast enough.  [Linksys Router]	router[+2][p]	It is a nice router in all ways but one.  [Linksys Router]	reliable[-2]	It is not reliable.  [Linksys Router]	access[-2][u]	A couple of times a week it seems to cease access to the internet. [Linksys Router]	access[-2][u]	That is, you cannot access the internet at all.  [Linksys Router]	router[-2][u]	Very annoying.    [Linksys Router]	Broadcom hardware[+2]	I also wanted to switch to Broadcom hardware (which the linksys uses) because my WiFi MiniPCI card in my dell laptop with lucent silicon in it used 70% of my 1.2Ghz laptop's CPU when using the wireless at full speed.  [Linksys Router]	CD[-3]	The installation software CD crashed repeatedly. [Linksys Router]	connection[-3]	I then tried to set up the router through Linksys's browser interface, but as the only instructions available tell you to use the installation CD, I had little luck - I did manage to connect briefly, but the connection kept dropping, and with no idea of how to resolve THAT issue, I gave up.   [Linksys Router]	wizard[-2]	I couldn't get the install wizard to work.  [Linksys Router]	instructions[+2]	However, setting up using the quick start instructions was a breeze.  [Linksys Router]	install[+2]	It's easy to install the security on this product but Linksys doesn't do a good job of explaining why its important.  [Linksys Router]	wizard[-2]	Knocked 1 star off for the install wizard - it wasted alot of time running it.     [Linksys Router]	Linksys[+][cc]	While I am not happy that a solid state device died after such a short period of time, my quick review of this product space did not yield any other brands that seem much better than Linksys.  [Linksys Router]	install[+2]	The new router came with an updated setup utility that makes getting the router installed a fairly straight forward process. [Linksys Router]	support[+3]	Unlike other reviewers, I have found the support to be responsive, almost no wait time on the phone, and relatively knowledgeable. [Linksys Router]	priced[+2]	Overall, this router seems like a reasonably priced product th![Linksys Router]	products[+2][u],support[+2]	at works as well as can be expected for products in this space and the company backs it up with good support.     [Linksys Router]	works[+2], range[+3]	It's easy and really works, with some incredible range.  [Linksys Router]	Compatibility[+3]	Compatability with other devices is excellent too; I've only found one 11b device that won't work with its mixed mode (and it won't work with *anyone's* mixed mode).[Linksys Router]	Setup[+3]	Setup in XP was instant and intuitive. [Linksys Router]	pipeline[+2][u]	The main advantage of this system over its predecessor is the ability to open a wider pipeline between clients. [Linksys Router]	quality[+3], tech support[+3]	Linksys quality and tech support have been outstanding.     [Linksys Router]	installation[+2]	My experience with installation was quite good.  [Linksys Router]	installation[+2]	I upgraded both my card and router and really had no problems with installation on my Sony VAIO laptop (XP operating system).  [Linksys Router]	wizard[+1][u]	The card basically installed itself and the "install wizard" on the CD that came with the router basically set the router up to work with one computer (with the 54g card) and also a second computer in my house (with an 11b card).  [Linksys Router]	setup[-1], documentation[+1]	The setup wasn't quite perfect the first time -- I needed to go through a web-based interface to set up the router (to give  it info on my DSL provider account), though the documentation for this was staightforward.  [Linksys Router]	set up[+1]	I haven't tried to set up any advanced features on the router, but it is not difficult to set up for basic use.  [Linksys Router]	documentation[+2][cs]	The documentation is much better than the documentation that came with the 11b router -- I needed a lot of help from Linksys technical assistance to set that one up.  [Linksys Router]	router[+][cs], signal strength[+2]	I like this router a whole lot better the Linksys 11b router it replaced -- the signal strength seems ot be much stroners, seldom falling below the "very good" range (and most often excellent within 25-50 feet of the router.  [Linksys Router]	transmission speed[+2]	The transmission speed is also quite good, with pages loading very quickly.  [Linksys Router]	backward[+2]	I have had no problem either with backward compatiaibility, in that the "mixed mode" feature lets you both 54 and 11 Mb cards off the router.     [Linksys Router]	router[+2]	As far as dealing with network access of other computers this router is pretty good given the price- remember this router is the same one that was released right when the G standard was introduced to the market. [Linksys Router]	use[+2][u], features[-2]	I like the fact that it IS EASY to use with limited networking experience- the problem I have is that there are many useless features on the unit, and some wanted features, like a list of computers accessing my wireless, is not easily found on my router.   [Linksys Router]	router[+1][p]	All in all, it's a good router if you don't have the cash for a Speedbooster one. [Linksys Router]	router[+2][u]	I just replaced my old Linksys router with this one, turned everything on in the right order, and it was up and running with no problems.  [Linksys Router]	set up[+3]	All of the wireless components that I bought were a breeze to set up as well.     [Linksys Router]	product[+3]	This product is by far the best Broadband Router on the market, I bought this to replace one of those Linksys Instant Wireless B routers, worked great for about a year. [Linksys Router]	range[+3], connection[+2][u]	My opion is concentrate on what you need now, This product has EXELENT range, holds a teady connection, hasent even droped one and i have it for more than a month now. [Linksys Router]	ROUTER[+3][s], works[+3]	IF YOU NEED A WIRELESS ROUTER.... GET IT GET IT GET IT.... works really good....     [Linksys Router]	product[+3], firmware update[+2]	I was an early purchaser of the WRT54G, and had a few problems with stability and speed - finally, the March 03 firmware update has resulted in an excellent product![Linksys Router]	satellite[-2][u]	It took me three days, to the tune of Neil Young's song "Piece Of Cr--!", to get this to work with the satellite hookup I was hired to connect this wireless network up to.  [Linksys Router]	tech support[-3], user guide[-1]	There is not a word about satellite issues in either the user guide or the "knowledge" database at linksys.com, and first tech support person I spoke with kept me on the phone for an hour, then gave me a web site address to consult--that turned out to be the one I'd already found during a search of my own.  [Linksys Router]	quality[+3]	I just upgraded to the Linksys WRT54G Wireless-G router last month and I am very happy with the quality of the product.  [Linksys Router]	multipurpose[+3][u]	This router acts as a wireless access point, 100 MB switch and a router making it a nice multipurpose device.  [Linksys Router]	connection[-1][u]	I was having intermittent problems with it losing connection. [Linksys Router]	setup[+2]	The inital setup of the router was simple. [Linksys Router]	Works[+2]	Works pretty well. [Linksys Router]	DHCP[+2][u]	The best part about this router is now I have a DHCP server. [Linksys Router]	product[+2], desktop card[-2][u]	This is a good product, but the Linksys 54g desktop card is not.  [Linksys Router]	desktops[-2]	I'd recommend this is you want to wireless network your laptop, but if you want to wirelessly network a couple desktops together you might want to wait until Linksys improves their desktop software/hardware.     [Linksys Router]	Linksys[+2]	My brother had an old Linksys B band wireless router in his home and it was like magic. [Linksys Router]	documentation[-1]	Unfortunately, Linksys does not write the best documentation.  [Linksys Router]	Linksys[+3]	Well Linksys was one of the original big players in the router industry.  [Linksys Router]	reliability[+2]	ying to point out they have experience, and so the reliability of the connection you get is among the best.  [Linksys Router]	model[+2][p]	This model appears to be especially good.  [Linksys Router]	set up[-1][u]	I tried to do this by instinct and it's not intuitive unless you are a network geek. [Linksys Router]	works[+2], cheap[+3]	The darn thing works as promised and it's amazingly cheap too. [Linksys Router]	work[+2], security[+2]	If you want to work wirelessly, this router does just what you want it to do and my geek friends say that the security is as good as it gets right now.             [Linksys Router]	setup[+3]	The setup was a breeze, I had some reservations about a wireless network (see my review for linksys wet11)but this item was on sale as well as the WET11 so I just had to splruge. [Linksys Router]	set up[+3]	To set up the xbox, wap, and ethernest bridge, with the encryption on was less then 30 mins. [Linksys Router]	setup software[+3]	The setup software did everything. [Linksys Router]	connection+3]	My Xbox connection seems as good as with a cable. [Linksys Router]	router[+2]	In a week of use i've never had to reboot the router. [Linksys Router]	speed[+3], signal quality[+2]	A decent peice of hardware with great speed (I get the same speeds as with my comp connected directly to the modem)  and good signal quality. [Linksys Router]	look[+1]	I guess the two antennae help with that besides making it look cooler. [Linksys Router]	speeds[+2]	I am getting better speeds on all my web programs. [Linksys Router]	router[+2][u][cc]	There seem to be fewer collisons and dropped packets as I read from the router logs than with my old Dlink router. [Linksys Router]	setting[-2]	I had a lot of problems setting it up, since the software given along with it is buggy. [Linksys Router]	firmware[-2]	The firmware has bugs too, so download and install the latest firmware from Linksys. [Linksys Router]	instant setup[-2]	The instant setup button in the front of the router messes up the network it is better to configure the router manually. [Linksys Router]	router[-][cc]	This is NOT a router I would suggest for a novice user, my old Dlink DI52![Linksys Router]	VOIP[+2]	It works well with my VOIP adapter, which is also a Linksys. [Linksys Router]	connection[-1]	The internet connection would go down every 5 mins when I used it with a P2P program called Bitspirit.  [Linksys Router]	Speed[+2][u],signal[+2],Configuration Options[+2]	Pros.1.Speed  2. Signal Strength  3.Advanced Configuration Options[Linksys Router]	Customer service[-1]	 So-So 1. Customer Service - 6 calls Half were efficient other half were equally incompetent.  [Linksys Router]	disconnecting[-2][u]	Both of them keep disconnecting on me and interruptions are 3 or 4 times per day at best. [Linksys Router]	junk[-3][p][s]	Stay away from this junk. [Linksys Router]	router[+2]	Purchased this router a few months back, NO PROBLEMS whatsoever.  [Linksys Router]	WPA encryption[+1]	In fact, it supports the new WPA encryption standard, which is WAY better than WEP.  [Linksys Router]	Works[+3][u]	Works perfectly with my netgear wireless PCMCIA. [Linksys Router]	Feature[+2][cc]	Feature wise, its a lot better than the dlink and netgear routers out there.     [Linksys Router]	software[-3]	Was a bit wary because the software is Windows only and I have an iMac. [Linksys Router]	working[+3]	Reset the network, tried the connection, and it's working like a charm. [Linksys Router]	Tivo[-1]	The downside being that the Tivo can only connect at 802.11b speeds and not 802.11g. [Linksys Router]	backward compatible[+3]	However since this Router is backward compatible, that doesn't pose a problem at all.  [Linksys Router]	connectivity[+2]	Overall, it'll make my move that much easier knowing I don't have to worry about connectivity.     [Linksys Router]	logging[-1]	(...)  Like most SOHO routers, it has nearly non-existant logging. [Linksys Router]	reliable[+2]	For more than a year, and it is totally reliable.  [Linksys Router]	signal[+3]	No down time, great signal strength.  [Linksys Router]	features[+3]	There is an open-source firmware on the net which has tons of extra features.  [Linksys Router]	Setup[+3], web site[+2]	Setup is totally breeze and Linksys's web site is pretty easy to navigate.  [Linksys Router]	cheapest[-1][u]	Now this router is not the cheapest on the market.  [Linksys Router]	firmware[+2]	The fact that has an open-source firmware makes it a great option in my opinion. [Linksys Router]	router[+2]	So the pretty solid router all around good for the money  here's the link to firmware updates http://www.sveasoft.com/forum6.html      [Linksys Router]	working[+2][u]	Absolutely no problems with this router. [Linksys Router]	instructions[+2]	I downloaded and updated the firmware, and followed the easy setup instructions. [Linksys Router]	customer support[+2]	A call to customer support (got to a live person within a couple of minutes) helped me tweak a couple of the settings to streamline performance.  [Linksys Router]	Speed[+2]	Speed is not a problem.      [Linksys Router]	works[+2][u]	After upgrading the drivers and firmware a few times and e-mailing tech support for some setting tips it now works fine. [Linksys Router]	Linksys[+2]	As far as Linksys goes, I have used several of their products and they seem to hold up well - no problems.     [Linksys Router]	setup[+2]	Getting the router setup in a "vanilla" configuration that works for 99% of users was very easy, and I was able to do this no problem.[Linksys Router]	CD[+3]	Second, the setup CD actually worked perfectly. [Linksys Router]	installation[+][cs]	I still need to read up on some of the security settings, etc to fully understand all that's up there, but bottom-line is that the installation was like night and day compared to the Speedboost router. [Linksys Router]	performance[+3], documentation[-2], support[-2][u]	The performance of the router itself deserves 5 stars, but the Linksys documentation and support is so poor that I can only give it 4. [Linksys Router]	manual[-2][u]	Even the PDF manual that comes with it is pretty vague for someone not familiar with "MAC settings", etc. [Linksys Router]	antenna[+1]	When I saw a high gain (low price) antenna was available to the WRT54G router, I thought I'd happily give up some (practically unattainable anyway, since you've got to be in spitting distance from the router) speed in favour of wider coverage. [Linksys Router]	signal[+2][u]	Having done all this, I was quite pleased to see that all corners I needed were decently covered by the signal. [Linksys Router]	speed[+2]	The box is upstairs, and in the farthest room I get connected at 11-18M speed - that is similar to the older 10M ethernet standard. [Linksys Router]	signal[+2][u]	Apart from speed, the signal is consistent and works without interruptions, etc. [Linksys Router]	coverage[+2][u]	the WRT54G plus the HGA7T is a perfect solution if you need wireless coverage in a wider area or for a hard-walled house as was my case.     [Linksys Router]	router[-3][p]	We bought this about 6 months ago and it's been worthless.  [Linksys Router]	connection[-2][u], slow[-2][u]	It constantly drops the internet connection and simple things like WALLS in our house block the link so everything is very slow.  [Linksys Router]	support[-3]	The tech support is worthless too.     [ipod]	features[-2]	 There isn't much features on the iPod at all, except games.[ipod]	sound[+2]	SOUND QUALITY: The iPod's sound quality is pretty good.[ipod]	equalizer[-1]	 It has an equalizer, but the iRiver H10-20GB has a lot more presets than the iPod. [ipod]	bass[+3],treble[+2]	The bass is deep and the treble is clear.[ipod]	battery[-2]	  DURABILITY: Not good. First problem, if you haven't seen the news recently, the iPods are being recalled for battery problems and not lasting the advertised 18 months.[ipod]	Replaceable battery[-3]	Also, the battery's AREN'T USER REPLACEABLE.[ipod]	flip side[-2]	 Another thing you should know, the metal on the flip side of the iPod is very tacky, and scratches very easily.[ipod]	case[-2]	 Also, not liking the gel case. [ipod]	features[-3]	 FEATURES: Really, there aren't any features, unless you call the games a feature. [ipod]	FM tuner[-3]	There is no FM tuner, while there is no FM tuner on the Creative Zen (on the micro version of the Zen there is a tuner), the iRiver H10-20GB, the Rio Karma, and the iAudio X5 have FM tuners. [ipod]	voice recording[-3]	 There is also no voice recording, something most if not all MP3 players have that the iPod doesn't.[ipod]	photo viewing[-1]	 There is no photo viewing option, however, there is a 20 GB photo iPod, but it costs $20 more.[ipod]	use[+3]	  EASE OF USE/DESIGN: The iPod is a very easy to use MP3 player, and if you can't figure this out, you shouldn't even own one.[ipod]	iTunes[-1]	I'm probably the only person that dislikes the iTunes software. [ipod]	CUSTOMER SERVICE[-3]	 CUSTOMER SERVICE: Awful. Listen to this one, remember the battery statement I made earlier. [ipod]	technical service[-3]	 There technical service isn't helpful either; they just read what's on their website and charge you $50 (+ toll fees) to do it.[ipod]	iPod[-3], sound quality[+2], design[+2]	OVERALL: I highly dislike the iPod, even though the sound quality and design is above-average. [ipod]	Ipod[+2]	The Ipod is a fine cousin to the early macs and current offerings from Jobs and Company. [ipod]	Apple[+2]	Long live Apple, long live Macs, and long live the Ipod!     [ipod]	ipod[+2]	I have an ipod and it is a great buy. [ipod]	sturdy[+2]	 Very sturdy and strong.[ipod]	games[-1]	 Doesn't have alot of good games on it.[ipod]	iPod[+3],service[-2]	iPod is brilliant, but service was awful[ipod]	iTunes[+2]	The software with the iPod includes iTunes, which allows you to play the music on your computer, rip CDs onto your computer, and move your music from the computer to the iPod. [ipod]	click wheel[+2]	This new click wheel iPod allows you to navigate through the menus and song via a touch-wheel for scrolling and click-able buttons for selection.  [ipod]	song quality[+3],ear buds[+3]	 The song quality of the iPod is excellent, and the included ear buds are actually more than satisfactory, for most users.[ipod]	scratches[-1]	 The back of the iPod is in a chrome finish, and this surface is prone to scratches. [ipod]	Battery life[+1]	 Battery life keeps improving on the iPod, and a new iPod will give you up to twelve hours of play time, per charge. [ipod]	Apple[+2]	Thank you Apple!  You make fabulous products. [ipod]	product[+2]	 The product I rate five stars, [ipod]	service[-2]	but I had to give you four because the service for my brand-new iPod was terribly slow.[ipod]	Amazon[+2]	  Plus, if you order from Amazon.com, they will exchange it for you no problem.  [ipod]	interface[-1]	 The interface took a little getting used to.[ipod]	display[+2]	 This one has a color display, which I like a lot, being very visual. [ipod]	photos[+2]	I loaded a lot of photos into it and they display very clearly for such a small screen and, very importantly, the transition from one photo to the next is instantaneous. [ipod]	sound[+1]	 The sound is just fine. [ipod]	adapter[+1]	It comes with an adapter to plug into the wall, which I hear is a step up from the other iPods, which require you plug it into a computer to charge it.  [ipod]	photo quality[-1]	 One caveat I have is that I understand the iPod does not save the photos in such a way that the quality of the image is preserved.[ipod]	Hard Drive[+2], affordable[+2]	 Pros: Large Hard Drive for the $$-- 20GB and 40GB are both affordable. [ipod]	Screen[+2]	Decently Sized Screen-- One of the larger ones on the market at 2" [ipod]	Battery[+1]	Decent Battery-- On the average size, but the 40GB comes with a dock.  [ipod]	FireWire[+3],USB[+3]	 FireWire & USB2.0-- For those fortunate enough to have FireWire400, your in for a real treat with autosync.[ipod]	Design[+3]	 Great Design-- Very sleek and touch wheel has still never been successfully copied (vertal ones are the only competition); and now the wheel clicks, taking away a lot of headaches from 3rd gen and very navigable in the menus. [ipod]	sound[+2],Durable[+2],compact[+1]	Good sound-- Plays very nicely, even though the stock headphones are kind of weak Durable-- not the most durable because its mostly plastic, but very compact and sturdy [ipod]	Games[+1]	Games-- not really important, but existant [ipod]	Hold[+1]	Hold Button-- suprisingly not all MP3s have this; this allows you  to have all the buttons unusable, so that you don't accidently hit something in your pocket. [ipod]	Radio Tuner[-2]	 Cons: No AM/FM Radio Tuner-- Something a large number of competetors are doing[ipod]	Voice Recorder[-2]	3 No Voice Recorder-- this has also become an important and popular feature that the iPod unfortunately doesn't have.[ipod]	Memory Stick slots[-2],Battery[-2]	 No Memory Stick slots-- Although a rare feature, it would be nice to have extra storage, not that it needs it Built-in Lithium Battery-- A huge hassle to bring this back; draining the battery once you get it helps, but removable/replaceable ones are a lot more convenient[ipod]	iTunes[+1]	. iTunes-- this is a love-hate relationship program; usually people with Mac like this program than people with a PC, but depending on your computer expertise, this could be a difficult program to use, and it is required for an iPod. [ipod]	accessories[-1]	No inbox accessories-- An arm strap, belt strap, case, or anything would be nice, but nope... Moveable parts-- This makes me almost want to keep my 3rd gen over a 4th; with moveable parts, its easy to damage an iPod at a gym, so this is for more casual listeners; note the iPod Mini doesn't have moveable parts and is made of titanium.[ipod]	Overall[+1]	  Comments: Overall this is still a great value, but is kind of overrated in the sense that there are beater deals on the market.[ipod]	Versatile[+2]	Versatile and stylish.	 [ipod]	design[+2],capacity[+2],connection options[+2],iTunes[+2]	I had a Casio unit, which had given great service, and would have been happy to get another one, but was tempted by the iPod's sleek design, storage capacity, connection options- - firewire and USB, and its integration with iTunes.   [ipod]	battery[-1]	The battery issue is superficially a concern, but any reasonable solder-jockey (such as myself :-) can pop in a new one when the time comes (based upon the plentiful info gained from a google for 'ipod battery replacement').   [ipod]	controls[+2]	The controls and the menus are clearly displayed and easily fathomed  [ipod]	iPod[+2]	 The iPod is a very nice product, which given reasonable care, should give a lot of service.      [ipod]	iPod[-1]	 First, let me say that I got the 20gb iPod for Christmas, and I most likely would not have spent the $300 myself. [ipod]	battery[-2]	In addition, I do not think the battery lasts much more than eight to ten hours, and it can take four hours for a full charge.[ipod]	quality[+2]	 I have about 6 gb used on my iPod so far (well over 1000 songs), and as far as I can tell, all of them play at near-cd quality.[ipod]	interface[+2], use[+3]	Other than the fact that one can't delete a file directly from the iPod, the interface is excellent and mind-numbingly simple to use.  [ipod]	iTunes[+1]	 As for iTunes, I don't find it to be as good as the Windows Media Player as a computer mp3 player, but it is good enough. [ipod]	iPod[+2]	 In conclusion, I gave the iPod a 4/5 because anything this expensive should would work just about flawlessly.[ipod]	sensitive[-2]	 *The ipod is overly sensitive to just about everything and gets scratched easily. [ipod]	Battery[-1]	The Battery does not last 12 hours.  [ipod]	battery[-2]	 You can't change the battery, so I don't know what I'm going to do in a year or so.[ipod]	volume[-1]	  *	You can't turn the volume up very high, but I think this might be for health reasons. *	[ipod]	freezes[-1]	My ipod freezes occasionally, which is especially annoying when you're in the middle of a game of "brick." *[ipod]	apple[-2]	If you call apple and tell them your ipod has been damaged, they charge you roughly $105.50 per minute and blame you for "abusing" your ipod.[ipod]	support service[-2]	 The user support service isn't too great either.  [ipod]	iPod[+2]	Everything I Wanted! The Apple iPod has become one of the most sought-after electronic gadgets - and for good reason.[ipod]	design[+2],capacity[+2],iTunes[+2]	 Its sleek design, large memory capacity, compatibility with iTunes, and ease of use makes this one of the best portable digital listening devices on the market. [ipod]	capacity[+2]	 Unless you have an enormous music/audio book library, the 20 GB model should have more than adequate storage capacity, with a stated ability to hold 5000 songs.  [ipod]	wheel[+2], backlighting[+2],iTunes[+2]	 Features: click wheel to navigate; ability to work with Windows or Mac; optional backlighting (you can have it on all the time, or have it shut off to save battery power after 5, 10, or 20 seconds); ability to download PDA info; automatic or manual download from iTunes when iPod is plugged into your computer. [ipod]	equalizer[+2]	There's even an equalizer (under "settings") that allows you to adjust the sound for acoustic, bass booster, bass reducer, classical, dance, "deep", and electronic.[ipod]	accessories[+1]	  With accessories, you can make the iPod into a digital recorder, broadcast it remotely through stereo speakers using wireless technology, and play it through your car speakers using either a CD adaptor or FM stereo broadcaster. [ipod]	reformatted[-2]	 The iPod comes formatted for the Mac, but within seconds of plugging it into a PC, is automatically reformatted for Windows.  (The HP version comes with Windows formatting, and takes seconds to change to Mac.) Although the iPod can be changed from one format to another, you will lose all of your music and data when doing so. [ipod]	ITunes[+2]	ITunes can be downloaded from the enclosed CD or for free from the Apple site.    [ipod]	steel backing[-2]	 Its steel backing picks up fingerprints and scratches easily, not great from a cosmetic standpoint.  [ipod]	device[+2][p]	All in all, this is a wonderful device.  [ipod]	weight[-1],solid feel[+2]	  The weight is heavier than many digital players, but I like the solid feel. [ipod]	scratch[-2]	Holy cow! It really does scratch easily!	[ipod]	scratches[-2]	  The thing has survived plenty of falls with little or no damage, except the inevitable scratches.[ipod]	Apple[+2]	  Apple has definately fulfilled its reputation in making quality equipment, and surprisingly wasn't as expensive as its reputation normally holds.  [ipod]	Apple[-2]	Apple closed their island to anything that resembled Microsoft, and clearly let Napster know it could not use their products with Napster's services. [ipod]	Battery[+2]	 Battery non-issue. [ipod]	iPod[+2],use[+2]	Finally, compare the iPod to other players on a cost/Gb, and also consider ease of use. [ipod]	iPod[+2]	The iPod is not overpriced compared to the market.[ipod]	purchase[+2]	This is the best purchase I've made in a very long time.[ipod]	sound[+3],bass[+3]	The sound is INCREDIBLE; very clean, very wide dynamic range of bass, mids and highs, and can be very loud if I turn it up full blast.[ipod]	Versatile[+2]	The Great And Versatile iPod	 I love my iPod! [ipod]	sound[+3],controls[+2]	 The sound quality is excellent, accessing the music is easy, and the controls are generally well thought out. [ipod]	iTunes[-1]	As a Windows user, I had to install the software including drivers and iTunes on my desktop, and this is the only area where I encountered a nuisance. [ipod]	iPod[+3]	 I still give the iPod five stars, though, as it could have been something I did incorrectly during the install (though I did follow the onscreen prompts) so I'll give Apple the benefit of the doubt.[ipod]	battery[+1]	The battery holds a charge for a very long time (maybe 15 or so hours of use) so realistically there are no real range or endurance issues associated with iPod use. [ipod]	outside finish[-2]	  My only complaint (really more of an observation) is that the outside finish of the iPod is rather delicate, so I am going to get a case for mine so it doesn't get all scratched up. [ipod]	quality of audio[+2],controls[+2],capacity[+2]	(It sure does look nice, though!)  I recommend this to any music lover anywhere: the quality of the audio is excellent, the controls and indicators rapidly become intuitive, and the storage capacity and battery life are huge!     [ipod]	iTunes[+2]	  Using the software iTunes is relatively simple, you just plug the USB cable in, wait your machine to detect the iPod and voila, any songs listed in your iTunes library will be transfered on over to the iPod.[ipod]	amplifier[+2]	 And, with the iPods' full volume up, all you have to do is adjust your receivers' volume and your set, since the iPod itself acts as a strong amplifer of its' own.[ipod]	proprietary[-1]	  If there were any complaints I have, they are marginal, but one is Apples' properietary set-up for music files, their incompatibility with other music services (i.e. Napster) is down right wrong.[ipod]	iPod[+2]	  However after purchasing a 20 GB iPod it's clear to see the superiority. [ipod]	iPod[+3], interface[+3], design[+3]	For a sleeker, smaller and more "average" MP3 player the Nitrus is great but the iPod blows it out of the water - the interface is great and the design is wonderful.[ipod]	play WMA[-2]	 Also, some other MP3 players such as the Nitrus allow you to play WMA (Windows Media Audio) files, whereas the iPod does NOT. [ipod]	USING[+2]	The actual experience of USING the iPod is magnificent.[ipod]	design[+2]	 The design, as mentioned above, is sleek, cool and trendy (and I think trendy = good, but it's always hard to tell these days). [ipod]	battery[+2]	 The battery life lastes 12 hours, and charges quickly. (As mentioned above, the initial charge is a minimum of only two hours - not too long at all!) Once you've downloaded your music, you can access the tracks by artist, genre, album, composer (this comes in handy when the actual composer is different from the artist - e.g. covers of songs), etc.[ipod]	sound quality[+3]	 The!  sound quality is great. [ipod]	earphones[+1]	The included earphones are pretty good - my advice? [ipod]	use[+2]	  The ease of use of the iPod is a major attribute.[ipod]	hard drive[+1]	 With the iPod, you can also store documents and contact files (from programs such as Microsoft Outlook) when it's connected to your PC as an external hard drive. [ipod]	games[+1]	Also included in the "games" section is the great music trivia option - which tests your skill at being able to quickly place your own songs. [ipod]	storage space[+2]	  20 GB OR 40 GB?  The pros of the 40 GB: Comes with a "dock station" and double storage space (10,000 songs).[ipod]	iPod[+2], capacity[+2], price[+2]	  Overall the iPod really is an almost flawless beast. The capacity in the 20 GB is more than I think most people would ever need and, for the price, I highly recommend it.[ipod]	Itunes[+2][u],Design[+2][u]	Everything else about the ipod is great, the click wheel is very easy to use and so is the software that comes with it.[ipod]	Finding[+2][u]	Finding all the albums, songs etc is much easier than you would think it would be even if you have 20 gig (well 18 gig) worth of music.[ipod]	sounds[+3]	  It all sounds great too. [ipod]	headphones[-3]	 As with most headphones that come with any type of music player,I recommend throwing these into the nearest river, unless you like having hard, round pieces of plastic in your ears. [ipod]	store[+2]	 You can even use the ipod to store files from your pc and export your outlook files to it.[ipod]	BATTERY[-3]	Because Steve Jobs is a twisted individual and he made sure that he ruined this device by giving it an UNREPLACABLE 18 MONTH BATTERY. [ipod]	batteries[-3]	  This was obviously a conspiracy as it is FREAKIN' EASY to manufacture a device with replaceable batteries!![ipod]	pay[-3]	However, in my mind, $299 is a lot to pay for a device that will only last 18 MONTHS. [ipod]	interface[-2]	 LOOKS AND DURABILITY: I realize many people are fond of the minimalist white interface.  [ipod]	scratches[-2]	The biggest red flag for me was the fact that although my cousin's player was relatively new, it was riddled with scratches.[ipod]	BATTERY[-3]	 BATTERY: Compared to the other players on the market, the iPod has one of the worst batteries around.[ipod]	iPod[+2]		 If, like me you simply want an iPod to play your mp3's, buy this one. [ipod]	reliability[+2]	So reliability is the winner here for the iPod.[ipod]	looks[+2]	For looks, well iPod is head and shoulders better, both the iRiver and Creative Zen look positively ugly when next to a gleaming iPod. [ipod]	package[+2]	 The iPod package comes with everything you need, the AC adaptor, firewire cable (quicker than USB, but slower than USB 2 which it also gives), those snazzy and powerfull headphones, and of course the player. [ipod]	design[-2]	 Maybe this new design is more durable than the last, but I kind of doubt it.  [ipod]	scratch[-2]	 We can start by losing the shiny miracle-material cover that you can literally scratch just by looking at it wrong, and thus eliminate the need for third-party "iSkin" protective covers for an extra thirty bucks.[ipod]	earbuds[-2][p]	First of all, I've never been big on earbuds - they're just not that comfortable.[ipod]	iPod[+2]	 These issues aside, the iPod is kind of like the cell phone in that once you have one, you can't be without one.[ipod]	alternative[-1]	  And if you're a Mac user like me, they've naturally made sure you have no viable alternative.  [ipod]	iTunes[+1]	Also, you have to use it with iTunes - or they'll sue, dammit!  But iTunes is about as good as anything. [ipod]	player[+2][p]	 The player is great. [ipod]	battery [-1]	 However, the battery life isn't as good as I would like. [ipod]	product[+2]	 Overall, this product is AWESOME. [ipod]	features[+2]	 All the "cool" features of the mini, but with 20GB instead of 5.  [ipod]	use[+2]	 Really easy to use.[ipod]	click wheel[+2]	 Has the click wheel and the ability to scan through thousnds of songs and organizes them great.[ipod]	helpline[+2]	 Has a great helpline.[ipod]	USB[+2},charger[+1]	 They fix the problem and help you with whatever your I-Pod needs Comes with two USB ports and a charger.[ipod]	I-Tunes[+1]	 They are EXTREMELY convient and you don't have to buy them seperately Has I-Tunes, which provides qulity music at low prices.[ipod]	Breaks[-2]	  Cons Breaks easily. [ipod]	Hard drive[-1]	Hard drive screws up occasionally[ipod]	I-Pod[+2]	The I-Pod is the best thing I have ever used. [ipod]	use[+2]	I found that to be the most impressive thing about the iPod 'mini' - basically for ease of use, and the feel it gives. [ipod]	USB[+1],firewire[+1]	 This unit comes with the USB/firewire cable as a standard item now. [ipod]	use[+2]	  I have transferred in about 2,400 tracks so far - very easy to use both the Ipod and iTunes. [ipod]	sound quality[+2]	I was worried about what the sound quality would be like, but that seems to be just as good as the actual CD sound.[ipod]	screen[-1]	This is only a problem at night, during the day the screen is very easy to see. [ipod]	features[+2]	I love the features on the iPod and the many things you can do with it. [ipod]	battery[-2]	 The only problem is the battery life.[ipod]	battery[-2]	Apple's iPod battery replacement service costs $100! [ipod]	arm band[+2]	The arm band is fantastic and it doesn't budge even at the gym.  [ipod]	design[+2]	I love the slim design; the weight would only be an issue if it were bulky.  [ipod]	sound[+3]	The ear buds that come with it look cheap, but the sound quality is amazing. [ipod]	click wheel[+2]	  The click wheel is incredibly convenient, however it can be a little overly touchy at times, which will make you frustrated with your own fingers.  [ipod]	iTunes[+2]	 I am a big fan of iTunes, simply because it is terribly fast and convenient - IF you are buying the songs from the iTunes site.  [ipod]	Apple[+2]	 Way to go Apple!  [ipod]	iPod[+2]	I rarely get drawn in by mass-commercialism, but something about the iPod made me say, in the words of Lou and Andy, "I WANT THAT ONE!" I was willing to shell out [Diaper Champ]	Works[+3]	Works great, no odor, and uses regular bags.[Diaper Champ]	Diaper Champ[+2]	So far (3 weeks), we've had no problems with the Diaper Champ at all.[Diaper Champ]	diapers[+2]	It contains the smell from our baby's diapers and we can use just about any kind of bag inside.[Diaper Champ]	odors[+2],refills[+2]	I don't know if we'll run into trouble down the road with odors, but so far I have no complaints and I'm very happy not to have to buy those refills.[Diaper Champ]	Diaper Champ[+3]	The Diaper Champ is the best we found![Diaper Champ]	bags[+2]	There are no specail bags to deal with or buy![Diaper Champ]	bag[+2]	We use the cheap $1.99 13 gallon vanilla scented bags from the grocery store but you can use any bag you have laying around.[Diaper Champ]	smelling[-1]	Now it will start smelling if you leave it with diapers in it for an extended period but all of them will![Diaper Champ]	diaper[+2]	We empty ours every day and we have never had an odors from it![Diaper Champ]	product[+3]	It is far better than just a trash can or the Diaper Genie and it's fairly inexpensive as baby products go![Diaper Champ]	refills[+3]	I love that you don't have to purchase expensive refills.[Diaper Champ]	diaper wipes[-2]	The cons, at times the diaper wipes get stuck in the disposal area making it hard to turn the handle back and forth.[Diaper Champ]	Diaper Champ[-2]	In addition, I don't believe that it is odorless.[Diaper Champ]	odor[-2]	My daughter is only 4 months old and we do notice an odor.[Diaper Champ]	Diaper Genie[+2][cs]	If I had to do it over again, even with the cost savings of using any type of bag, I would go w/ the Diaper Genie.[Diaper Champ]	Diaper Champ[+3][p][cc]	It's far better than all others on the market.[Diaper Champ]	convenient[+2],refills[+2]	it's easier and much more convenient to use because it doesn't have CLUMSY and CONFUSING (not to mention expensive) refills.[Diaper Champ]	use[+3]	There is no odor and extremely easy to use.[Diaper Champ]	garbage bags[+2]	1. It uses regular garbage bags instead of brand refills.[Diaper Champ]	product[+3][p]	3. It never smelled - at all.[Diaper Champ]	container[+2]	The container is hard to open, which is exactly what you want when your baby becomes a toddler, and you do have to flip the handle carefully (which has saved more than a few of her toys,too.) I don't consider these difficulties but features for the older baby.[Diaper Champ]	size[-2][u]	Even with newborn diapers it filled way too fast.[Diaper Champ]	size[-2],odor[-2][u]	It seemed as if we were empting the pail everyday and it was in no way odorless.[Diaper Champ]	product[+3][u]	This is a MUST HAVE product for all new moms![Diaper Champ]	Diaper Genie[-2][cs]	The Diaper Genie needs it's own refill bags in order to work and that's just more money that you don't have to spend.[Diaper Champ]	work[+3]	This is easy to work and easy to dispose of the dirty diapers.[Diaper Champ]	item[-2][u]	I find the major problem with this item is that if you have a very messy diaper and can't tightly bundle it without a mess, the mess gets all over the module that dumps the diaper and the stink is OUTSIDE of the diaper pail.[Diaper Champ]	fit[-2]	My main complaints are that it should be deeper or wider as it doesn't even fit a smaller sized garbage bag.[Diaper Champ]	hole[-2]	The hole to put the diaper in needs to be larger as I am now using medium diapers (I have a 3 month old) and they're on the brink of being too large to fit no matter how compact I make then and how un-soiled they are.[Diaper Champ]	odors[-2],deal[+1]	This pail doesn't really keep in odors anymore and we'll probably have to get a new one, but since you can use regular garbage bags (we actually use the bags we get our groceries in because they hang perfectly) its still probably a better deal than the genie.[Diaper Champ]	fill[+2], unload[+2]	It is much easier to fill and unload than the Diaper Genie, plus, why buy refills when you can use trash bags from the Dollar Store?[Diaper Champ]	diaper[+3]	It also holds a lot more diapers.[Diaper Champ]	size[+1]	look at the size of it![Diaper Champ]	odor[-1]	I have noticed an odor (one the I expected!) when unloading the Diaper Champ but at least you don't smell anything every time you use it.[Diaper Champ]	diaper[+3]	I highly recommend this![Diaper Champ]	diaper genie[-2][cs]	For my first I had a diaper genie which was not only costly with the refills but it was also very stinky.[Diaper Champ]	Diaper Champ[+1][p]	I have to say that I am very happy with it so far.[Diaper Champ]	replacement[+2]	I am happy with the fact that I can use any bag in there and dont' have to pay out the nose for replacements.[Diaper Champ]	use[+3]	It's also so easy to use and holds a great deal of diapers.[Diaper Champ]	Champ[+3]	The bags attach inside the Champ easily and all one has to do is cram the diaper down and flip the handle.[Diaper Champ]	function[-1][u]	But, sometimes, if the Champ is too full, the flip handle won't function.[Diaper Champ]	diaper[-2]	(I never know when the Champ is full as there is no way too tell.  Even though not particularly aesthetic, how about making the Champ clear and see-through?) So, I lift the lid and find a wad of diaper, which I must remove, usually stuck inside the lid itself because the bag is too full.[Diaper Champ]	diaper pail[+2]	I bought this diaper pail when my son was just a few days old and I absolutely LOVE it![Diaper Champ]	use[+3]	The diaper champ couldn't be easier to use.[Diaper Champ]	refills[+3]	And the biggest plus is that you don't have to buy any expensive refills.[Diaper Champ]	odor[+3][cs]	And it does an excellent job of keeping the odor contained, which the diaper genie never did![Diaper Champ]	diaper champ[+2]	If you are looking for a user-friendly diaper pail that actually does keep the odor contained, than the diaper champ is the one for you![Diaper Champ]	ITEM[+3],use[+2],odor[+3]	THIS ITEM IS EXCEPTIONAL I like the ease of use and it held the odor in great.[Diaper Champ]	Diaper Champ[+3]	Diaper Champ is by far the best diaper pail![Diaper Champ]	holds[+3]	It holds a lot of diapers, not to mention the odor![Diaper Champ]	use[+3]	It's easy to use (just a flip of the lid, and the diaper is gone!).[Diaper Champ]	empty[+3]	It's also easy to empty out.[Diaper Champ]	garbage bags[+3]	And best of all, no wasting money on special refill bags---this takes ordinary garbage bags![Diaper Champ]	diaper pail[+3]	Whether you are using disposable or cloth diapers, this is the truly the only diaper pail to get![Diaper Champ]	pail[+3],odor[+3][u]	Even though I never ventured into the cloth land, I was very impressed by how well this works at keeping diapers and their accompanying odor in the pail and out of our life![Diaper Champ]	Opening[-1]	Opening the Champ to empty out the bag is a little tricky- I pinched my thumb a few times before I got the hang of it.[Diaper Champ]	refills[+3]	Being a very economical person, I appreciate the fact that any plastic bag can be used with this system- I never did like the prospect of buying special Diaper Genie refills.[Diaper Champ]	plunger[-1]	As one other reviewer pointed out, it does occasionally take a little effort to push down the "plunger" to get the diapers in the pail, even though upon inspection the bag doesn't really look full.[Diaper Champ]	emptying[+1]	But from my experience, by the time it gets to that point, the bag is really heavy, so I think this is kind of helpful- it's a built-in way of keeping the bag manageable upon emptying.[Diaper Champ]	gift[+3][p]	This is a really great buy, for yourself or as a shower gift.[Diaper Champ]	Champ[+3]	Go for the Champ.[Diaper Champ]	product[+3][u]	I love this product![Diaper Champ]	dispose[+3]	With the enormous numbers of diapers that you go through with a newborn, it was great how easy it was to dispose of the dirty ones.[Diaper Champ]	trash bags[+3][u]	Plus, the fact that it used regular trash bags is great.[Diaper Champ]	refills[+3]	No need to pay for the special refills that the other brands require![Diaper Champ]	product[+3][p]	and we still LOVE it![Diaper Champ]	holds[+3]	*holds a LOT of diapers--a full week of toddler diapers![Diaper Champ]	trash bags[+3]	(we wrap them nice and tight) *we use our regular kitchen trash bags--cheap![Diaper Champ]	odor[+3]	*holds the odor in nicely![Diaper Champ]	use[+3]	(every now and then I spray down the inside of the pail with Lysol) *easy one-hand use *impossible for my inquisitive child to get the dirty diapers OUT of the pail Every now and then odors do escape the pail, but that is rare--and it usually just means that we've crammed too much in there and need to change the bag.[Diaper Champ]	Diaper Champ[+3][u]	We keep the Diaper Champ in our daughter's nursery and her room definitely does NOT smell like dirty diapers.[Diaper Champ]	holds[+3]	It holds quite a few diapers, and pops them in quickly and easily.[Diaper Champ]	trash bags[+3]	I use the same store-brand tall kitchen trash bags I already use in the kitchen for it -- no special "diaper" trash bags necessary.[Diaper Champ]	opening[-1]	The opening could be a little wider, I suppose, but I haven't really seen anything else that could be improved.[Diaper Champ]	works[+2]	It works with a minimum of fuss.[Diaper Champ]	diaper champ[+3][u]	The diaper champ turns the smelly diaper into "what diaper smell" in less time than that.[Diaper Champ]	purchases[+3]	This is one of the best purchases we made.[Diaper Champ]	product[+3],use[+3],effective[+3][u]	Great product, easy to use, economical, effective, absolutly fabulous.[Diaper Champ]	champ[+3][cs]	Update I knew that I loved the champ, and useing the diaper genie at a friend's house REALLY reinforced that![Diaper Champ]	champ[+3],odor[+3][cs]	There is no comparison, the chanp is easy and smell free, the genie was difficult to use one handed (which is absolutly vital if you have a little one on a changing pad) and there was a deffinite odor eminating from the genie plus we found that the quick tie garbage bags where the ties are integrated into the bag work really well because there isn't any added bulk around the sealing edge of the champ.[Diaper Champ]	pail[+3]	I love this pail![Diaper Champ]	smell[+3],ease of use[+3],garbage bags[+3][u]	No smell, easy to use with one hand free, and best of all it uses regular tall kitchen garbage bags so you don't get suckered in to using only the bags made for the pail that are imposible to find![Diaper Champ]	diaper pail[-2]	Solid food poop is VERY STINKY and this diaper pail doesn't really contain the smell.[Diaper Champ]	diaper pail[-2][u]	I still like it a lot and am not changing it for another, but it is sort of stinky.[Diaper Champ]	diaper pail[+3][p]	I think it's great.[Diaper Champ]	diaper pail[-2]	I just wished that it didn't fill up so fast![Diaper Champ]	diaper pail[+2]	It definitely keeps the smell out.[Diaper Champ]	odor[-2]	But now that she is eating solids the odor is escaping out and we are constantly using airfreshner.[Diaper Champ]	odor[+1][u]	First 4 months it was in our bedroom and we did not even smell any odor.[Diaper Champ]	odor[-1]	But be prepared to buy something else (diaper genie ?) which can trap the odor better.[Diaper Champ]	diaper champ[+3]	The diaper champ is the best![Diaper Champ]	Champ[+3]	I have tried other pails, but none have compared positively to the Champ.[Diaper Champ]	use[+3]	1) The champ is easy to use.[Diaper Champ]	Champ[+2][u]	With the Champ all you had to do was drop the dirty diaper into the opening and flip the lid.[Diaper Champ]	dispose[+2]	It was so easy my toddler would dispose of her on diapers.[Diaper Champ]	store bags[+3][u]	2) The Champ uses regular store bags.[Diaper Champ]	Champ[+3]	You do not have to waste money or time trying to purchase special bags for the Champ.[Diaper Champ]	Champ[+3]	3)The Champ is Odor Free for at least 15 months.[Diaper Champ]	Champ[+2]	The Champ did not start letting a little odor through until well over a year.[Diaper Champ]	other pail[-2][cc]	The other pail I used started to smell after 2 weeks of use.[Diaper Champ]	Champ[+3]	Regardless to this fact, I believe the Champ is the best way to go.[Diaper Champ]	Champ[+3]	Let the Champ win you over![Diaper Champ]	odor[+3]	No need for deodorizers.[Diaper Champ]	empty[+3]	I use the regular kitchen trash bags and it is so easy to empty.[Diaper Champ]	noise[+3]	even did while daughter sleep and no noise![Diaper Champ]	smell[+3]	I use the scented bags and even if I don't no smell![Diaper Champ]	space[+3][u]	This holds alot and does not take up alot of space.[Diaper Champ]	top loader[-2]	We found that when you put a dirty diaper into the top loader, there was a tendency to get streaks which would then get on the plunger which would then have to get cleaned each time it was used.[Diaper Champ]	Diaper Champ[-2]	We resorted to using small plastic bags to store the dirty diapers and dumping them in a trash can and using the Diaper Champ for wet diapers only.[Diaper Champ]	diaper wipes[-2]	We also had a problem with diaper wipes getting caught when the top was flipped.[Diaper Champ]	Diaper Champ[+1][cs]	But like I stated, its better then a trash can, but I'm not sure if its better then the Diaper Genie.[Diaper Champ]	diapers[+3],refills[+3]	It holds almost a week's worth of diapers, and you don't need expensive refills - any kitchen bags work.[Diaper Champ]	smell[+2]	At first I had a problem with some smell, then I realized if you flip the lid back and always keep the same side facing in - then there is no smell at all![Diaper Champ]	Diaper Champ[+3]	Personally, I am VERY pleased with the Diaper Champ.[Diaper Champ]	operate[+3][u]	It is mindless to operate.[Diaper Champ]	Diaper Champ[+3][u]	It doesn't stink, ever (like some have assumed since it doesn't wrap each diaper into its own neat little cocoon).[Diaper Champ]	clean[+3]	And it is very easy to clean.[Diaper Champ]	diaper[+3]	I can keep one hand on my baby and dump the diaper at the same time, it is that simple.[Diaper Champ]	diaper pail[+3]	This is a great diaper pail.[Diaper Champ]	use[+3]	There is no odor and it is very easy to use.[Diaper Champ]	refills[+3]	(You can do it one handed while still hanging on to the baby.) Also, we like using regular trash bags instead of having to worry about buying refills (like with the Diaper Genie).[Diaper Champ]	diaper pail[+3],space[+2]	And it's the largest diaper pail I've seen without taking up more floor space.[Diaper Champ]	Champ[+3][cc]	and we definitely prefer our Champ![Diaper Champ]	cost effective[+3],use[+3],capacity[+3][cs]	Not only is it much more cost effective (you can use regular trash bags rather than Refills at $5 a pop), it is easier to use and clean, and has a larger capacity.[Diaper Champ]	unit[-2]	it can be frustrating and messy when you put that last diaper in before realizing the unit is full.[Diaper Champ]	pluger[-2]	The pluger gets stuck & you have to manually extract the mess.[Diaper Champ]	item[-1]	I registered for this item because of the good reviews it got, however I was not impressed.[Diaper Champ]	diapers[-2]	For one thing, The diapers always get jammed in it.[Diaper Champ]	product[-2]	The product also leaves a faint smell in the room.  [Diaper Champ]	Diaper Champ[-1]	All in all, the Diaper Champ serves its purpose, but it does not live up to its good reviews.[Diaper Champ]	diaper champ[+1]	I got the diaper champ because of the great reviews as well as the fact that you can use regular garbage bags.[Diaper Champ]	works[+3]	It works great.[Diaper Champ]	smell[+3]	I can't smell anything (and believe me, this is quite something with my baby).[Diaper Champ]	works[+2]	I ended up buying one for upstairs and one for downstairs because it works so well and because I change him so often downstairs.[Diaper Champ]	Diaper Champ[+2]	We have been using our Diaper Champ for almost 14 months now and we are very happy with it.[Diaper Champ]	odors[+2]	It sits in the corner of our bathroom and we have never had any problems with odors at all (and we live in the damp and humid South, where odors of all kinds are generally rife).[Diaper Champ]	install[+2],change[+1],clean[+2],use[+3]	It is easy to install and change the ordinary trash bags, easy to clean, and most important, easy to use one handed - just insert folded dirty diaper and flip the handle.[Diaper Champ]	wipes[+1]	We have never had any problems with anything like loose wipes getting stuck (we always wrap them in the dirty diaper).[Diaper Champ]	open[+1]	It is a bit difficult to get the unit open (the advice to take it slowly is sound), but now that our son is walking and exploring, I consider this a positive attribute![Diaper Champ]	use[+2],odors[+2],bargins[+2]	Update (March 2005): My son has been out of diapers for almost 2 years now, but the Diaper Champ hung in there till the very end - easy to use, no problems with odors, and one of the best bargains among all of the paraphernalia required for the modern baby :-)[Diaper Champ]	Diaper Champ[+2][cc]	I decided to go with the Diaper Champ rather than the more popular Diaper Genie, because I didn't like the idea of having to buy special bags.[Diaper Champ]	costly[-2][u][cc]	 Too costly and not efficient if you ask me![Diaper Champ]	PRODUCT[+3]	THIS PRODUCT IS A LIFESAVER!![Diaper Champ]	ODOR[+3]	I HAVE NEVER HAD AN ODOR PROBLEM![Diaper Champ]	odor[+2]	No one has ever come to my house and noticed 'diaper odor.'[Diaper Champ]	Diaper Champ[+2]	In fact, people who have been present while I changed my almost 3 month old son's diaper have been amazed at how the very 'potent' smell of the dirty diaper seems to disappear once I dispose of the diaper in the Diaper Champ.[Diaper Champ]	CLEAN[-1]	2. YOU STILL HAVE TO CLEAN THE THING!![Diaper Champ]	WORKS[+2]	SIMPLE AND IT WORKS![Diaper Champ]	Diaper Champ[-1]	Also, for those that complain that the Diaper Champ isn't as effective as time passes, keep the following in mind: AS BABIES GET OLDER, THEIR DIETS CHANGES (aka SOLID FOODS!) AND SO DOES THE SMELL OF THEIR DIAPERS![Diaper Champ]	product[+2],price[+2]	All in all, this product is definitely one I would recommend and certainly worth the very reasonable price.[Diaper Champ]	diaper champ[+3],use[+2],refills[+1]	I love the diaper champ, it is really easy to use and since you can use regular garbage bags it doesn't cost an arm and a leg for refills.[Diaper Champ]	pail[-2]	The only downside to this is that it can get pretty stinky long before the pail is full.[Diaper Champ]	pail[-2]	I wash ours out with lysol each time I empty it, and that helps, but when its hot out- well, just be prepared.[Diaper Champ]	ODEROUS[-3]	That's when it went from Oderless, to ODEROUS![Diaper Champ]	semelled[-2]	It still smelled.[Diaper Champ]	smell[-2]	Then it started to smell whether there were diapers in it or not.[Diaper Champ]	bags[+2]	Using your own bags is much cheaper and convenient.[Diaper Champ]	height[+2]	The height is a more convenient reach than others, where you have to hunch over.[Diaper Champ]	stable[+2]	Its stable, so a curious toddler can't easily tip it over.[Diaper Champ]	open[-2]	CONS - Difficult to open to change bag-twice my bags caught on a sharp edge inside and snagged as I was pulling out-leaving dirty diapers all over the floor.[Diaper Champ]	diapers[-2]	Also, diapers tend to stay in the middle, causing the pail to get backed up.[Diaper Champ]	Diapers[-2]	Diapers can get stuck when turned around if you don't tightly wrap them first. [Diaper Champ]	product[+2]	I wanted this product because i didn't have to buy special bags for it and it also came highly recommended.[Diaper Champ]	open[-1]	The only problem i have is with the handle you use to open the top compartment.[Diaper Champ]	pull[-1]	The way you have to shove your fingers under it and pull is just too tight.[Diaper Champ]	open[-2]	I can't tell you how many times i've chipped a nail or hurt my fingertips because of the force needed to open it.[Diaper Champ]	product[+3]	This is a GREAT product![Diaper Champ]	Diapers[-1][cc]	I had never liked the idea of the Diaper Genie because of the refills.[Diaper Champ]	works[+2]	The Champ works great.[Diaper Champ]	garbage bags[+1]	We use regular kitchen sized garbage bags.[Diaper Champ]	odor[+2]	We've never experienced odor from the pail.[Diaper Champ]	assemble[+2], fit[+2]	It was easy to assemble, and the diapers fit perfectly into the little nook before they make their way into the pail portion.[Diaper Champ]	filp[+2]	I also love that you can flip the device with one hand...[Diaper Champ]	unit[+3]	Excellent diaper disposal unit.[Diaper Champ]	product[+3]	I am soooo pleased with this product!!![Diaper Champ]	investment[+2]	A wise investment for the pocketbook & for the nose!!![Diaper Champ]	Diaper Champ[+3]	Diaper Champ is great.[Diaper Champ]	Diaper Champ[+3]	So I can't tell you if Diaper Champ will be as good at containing the formula generated poop smell, but it's excellent at containing the smell of poop of my breastfed baby![Diaper Champ]	Diaper Champ[+2][cc]	Friends told me that the Diaper Genie did not work very well, so bought the Diaper Champ based on on-line reviews and I have been happy with it.[Diaper Champ]	works[+2]	It works easily with one hand, which is important.[Diaper Champ]	trash bag[+2]	Also, it takes any kitchen sized trash bag, so there is no special bag to stock.[Diaper Champ]	Diaper Champ[+2]	While the perfect ordor free diaper pail has yet to be invented, the Diaper Champ is a good as it gets.[Diaper Champ]	seal[-2]	Gets stinky after a few months, the seal on the piston doesn't seal anymore.[Diaper Champ]	wipes[-2]	Also, diapers and wipes get stuck in the grove below the piston.[Diaper Champ]	diaper Dekor[-1][cc]	I gave up and got a diaper Dekor.[Diaper Champ]	stinky[-1]	Also much less stinky.[Diaper Champ]	diaper champ[-3]	Don't buy the diaper champ.[Diaper Champ]	pail[+1],worked[+2]	I was using the cheapie pail...and it worked ok until the opening device fell apart.[Diaper Champ]	product[+2]	I could probably use a trash can and be ok at this point, but this prduct seems to work very well so far.[Diaper Champ]	pail.[+3]	This one is really great.[Diaper Champ]	Champ[+2]	I actually took a friends word on it and went with this Champ when registering and I am glad I did.[Diaper Champ]	Champ[+3]	Well the Champ has survived it's first year with our son and it is great!![Diaper Champ]	refills[+3]	The thought of not having to buy refills and just using regular bags is awesome![Diaper Champ]	work[+2]	We just buy the smaller bags that come like 250 to a roll and are sented and they are like $6.00 and they work great.[Diaper Champ]	bags[+3]	We just recently had to buy another roll of bags. SO $6.00 for a year of bags- can't beat that!![Diaper Champ]	change[+2]	We lysol the champ every time we change the bag out and have not had any problems.[Diaper Champ]	diaper pail[+2]	This is really a nice diaper pail.[Diaper Champ]	diaper pail[+2]	I recommend it to both parents of infants and toddlers.[Diaper Champ]	diaper pail[+2]	In fact, I liked it so much after using it with my son who is now 2 years old, that I bought one for our new baby's room.[Diaper Champ]	diaper pail[+1][cc][p]	Wow - was that disappointing and we didn't even have it 6 months before it broke.[Diaper Champ]	Diaper Champ[+2]	I bought the Diaper Champ and have been very happy for the following reasons.[Diaper Champ]	refills[+2]	1.  The Diaper Champ doesn't require special refills that are expensive and hard to find![Diaper Champ]	work[+2]	We just use the Glad tall kitchen trash can bags with odor shield from Target and they work wonderfully.[Diaper Champ]	refills[+2]	We don't have to worry about running out of refills with this diaper pail![Diaper Champ]	operated[+2]	2.  It can be operated with one hand - Leaving a hand on your baby on the changing table.[Diaper Champ]	safer[+2][cc]	So much safer than the others that require a two handed operation![Diaper Champ]	Diaper Champ[+2]	The Diaper Champ is so simple that my toddler loves to put his own diapers in the diaper champ and flip over the handle.[Diaper Champ]	change[+2]	3.  Bags are easy to change.[Diaper Champ]	smell[-1]	Yes, you may get a whiff of a smell when you flip the handle, but then it is gone.[Diaper Champ]	smells[-1][s]	To eliminate any smells we simple stuck a Stick Up room deodorizer inside the lid.[Diaper Champ]	Works[+3]	Works great!!!![Diaper Champ]	price[+2]	5.  The price is right.[MicroMP3]	instruction[-2]	Unfortunately, Creative offered scant few pages of instruction, which meant that I was on own from the outset. [MicroMP3]	touch-pad[-2], navigate[-3]	After attempting to navigate the clumsy touch-pad system, I could not get the unit to download my wma files. [MicroMP3]	EXPLAIN[-3]	SO, YOU MIGHT INQUIRE, WHY DON'T THEY MAKE IT A FIRST PRIORITY TO CAREFULLY, SIMPLY EXPLAIN HOW DOWNLOAD MUSIC FROM YOUR MUSIC LIBRARY TO THEIR DEVICE??? This seems academic to me.[MicroMP3]	navigating[-3]	Most of us just want to plug and play, not spend a year navigating a maze of complicated options...like transfering everything on a hard drive to this stupid thing.[MicroMP3]	sound[+2]	All of this said [as it's on it's way back to Amazon], the one song it did include provided far better sound than the IPOD. [MicroMP3]	bass[+2],highs[+2]	The base was deeper and the highs were crisper. [MicroMP3]	touch-pad[-3], instruction[-3]	Unfortunately, the touch-pad issues [non-intuitive] and poor instruction guide killed it. [MicroMP3]	machine[+3]	what a kick butt Mp3 machine and the freedom to get songs from a reasonable source, instead of paying for them two or three times, then get the Creative Zen IPOD killer, kiss my ass Itunes![MicroMP3]	Zen Micro[-2]	This one is particularly bothersome: Allegedly one can use the Zen Micro as a portable drive to store and transport data from one computer to another.[MicroMP3]	store[+2], INSTALL[-2]	Although you can store any type of file on the Zen Micro to download onto a different computer, you need to INSTALL (on the computer you are moving the data to) Zen Micro software and drivers to do it!!! [MicroMP3]	software[-2]	Who wants to go through the hassles of loading software onto a "foreign" computer just to move over some simple (*.txt) files?  [MicroMP3]	sound[+3], portability[+2]	The sound is great, the portability, etc... all the "stuff" you expect from a good MP-3 player, this Zen Micro has it. [MicroMP3]	Button sensitivity[-2]	) Button sensitivity: Even reduced to the lowest sensitivity setting, the buttons are far two sensitive, really takes some getting use to, and even then, it is still too sensitive. [MicroMP3]	FEATURE[-3], recharge cord[-3]	) WORST FEATURE POSSIBLE, THIS ALONE MAKES IT RATE ONE STAR: What's up with no recharge cord? [MicroMP3]	cost[-3]	You have to purchase that separately for some outrageous cost. [MicroMP3]	charged[-2]	I took my Zen Micro with me over the weekend, and was forced to lug my laptop with me on the trip for one reason: to keep the Zen Micro charged. [MicroMP3]	product[-2]	I have trashed this product on other opinion sites based on this major flaw alone. [MicroMP3]	prices[-3]	) Creative, Inc. the maker includes the barest of the bare minimum in the box, then through gross profiteering nickles and dimes you on EVERY single accessory at extraordinarily inflated prices. [MicroMP3]	case[-2]	The box included a little polyester, pull-string BAG, (yes, you read right a BAG, something a boy would carry ten marbles in) and tries to pass it off as the case. [MicroMP3]	case[-2]	If you want to purchase a real case or container or clip-on carrier for you Zen Micro, expect to purchase it separately and to dish out big time. . [MicroMP3]	battery[+3]	) One outstanding positive feature is the battery. It holds a charge for a long time, longer than most other similar products and the user can replace it easily or take another along as a backup. [MicroMP3]	rechargeable battery[+3]	Creative did well on its rechargeable battery feature. .[MicroMP3]	FM receiver[+1]	The Zen Micro FM receiver is ok, not great. [MicroMP3]	FM receiver[-][cc]	IRiver has a better FM receiver built in, but the drawback to IRiver products is they are flimsy and poorly constructed. [MicroMP3]	constructed[+3][u]	) The Zen Micro appears sturdy and well constructed, hefty, if you will, far better than many of its competitors. . [MicroMP3]	charges[-2]	As I wrote, this COULD have been a great product, but expect hidden charges (read gross profiteering and price gouging) as the company royally sticks you on every conceivable accessory necessary for normal daily usage.     [MicroMP3]	Zen Micro[+2]	Well, I have an Ipod mini - and I really like it, but all in all, I like the Zen Micro more.[MicroMP3]	size[+2], space[+2][u], battery[+2], look[+2]	Smaller size, 1 gb of more space, radio, voice recording, removable battery, cooler look, all in one.  [MicroMP3]	touchpad[-1]	The touchpad is annoying sometimes (give me the click-wheel and pressable buttons any day), but not at all as difficult to get over as other people are saying.[MicroMP3]	small[+3]	I love how small the thing is, and the blue glow - I've had it for two weeks with no electronic problems at all.  [MicroMP3]	Media Source[+2], file transfers[+3]	Creative Media Source is very easy to use once you get the hang of it, and the file transfers are fast.  [MicroMP3]	Sound[+2], fm tuner[+2], recorder[+2]	Sound quality is great, fm tuner is fine, as is the recorder.  [MicroMP3]	player[+2]	This is the mp3 player with everything I need.  As long as it lasts me a good three years, I'm satisfied.        [MicroMP3]	player[+2][p]	Also If you want a device that does soo much more than the Ipod mini but is at the same price, this is the player for you. [MicroMP3]	Headphones[-2]	and supply those stupid white Headphones. [MicroMP3]	small[+3][u]	Upon opening the box I was confronted with this small cute little MP3 player. [MicroMP3]	installation[+3]	The software included is an easy installation and you have the option of using the Creative software, Windows Media Player 10, or simply Windows Explorer to move music back and forth between your Zen Touch. [MicroMP3]	touch pad[-1]	The touch pad does take a little getting used to. [MicroMP3]	cable[+1],adapter[+1],headphones[+1], stand[+1],pouch[+1]	The package also comes with a USB cable, an AC adapter, a pair of headphones (they're okay until you get a better pair), a stand, and a microfiber pouch to carry your Zen Touch in.  [MicroMP3]	Zen Touch[+3][u]	Overall I'm incredibly impressed with my new Zen Touch. [MicroMP3]	looks[+3]	It's cute as anything and the glowing blue LED looks super cool around the edges. [MicroMP3]	player[+2]	For the price I think this is a remarkably fun MP3 player.[MicroMP3]	player[+3][p]	I've had this player for more than 4 months and I'm very happy with it. [MicroMP3]	Speakers[+2]	1 Speakers at home, I rarely use it with the earbuds, though they are much better than the ones you normally get with other mp3 players.  [MicroMP3]	Look[+3], Feel[+3]	The Look & Feel: I have the black one and the contrasting neon blue on the buttons add a very nice ambience. [MicroMP3]	tiny[-1][u], back[+3]	The player itself is tiny , it gets a bit bulky when you put it in the hardcase, which you need to do if you don't want to get scrathes on the back(its a nice looking back too ). [MicroMP3]	feels[+2][p]	It feels tiny in the hand without it. [MicroMP3]	stand[+2]	The stand that comes with it is very useful to prop it up on the desk. [MicroMP3]	looks[+3], read[+2][u]	The blue backlit LCD looks really neat and is easy to read. [MicroMP3]	touch controls[-1]	The touch controls took a little getting used to but now I wouldn't change it for the scroll wheel. [MicroMP3]	touch buttons[+3]	The touch buttons are textured so that your finger sdon't slip which was very thoughtful.   [MicroMP3]	Build[+3]	Reliability & Build  I dropped the player once from about 4 ft, and it fell hard, but kept on playing. [MicroMP3]	hardcase[+1]	The hardcase they give with it must work well.  [MicroMP3]	solid[+2][p]	It feels solid and not flimsy like the carbon.  [MicroMP3]	sound[+3]	Sound  I'm no audiophile but I was amazed by the clarity the player had, it was much better than the sound card on my Computer and louder too. [MicroMP3]	sound[+3]	I have had the ipod mini and it performs on the level with my sound card but the micro beats it outright.  [MicroMP3]	sound[+3]	Best of all the WMAs(I have a lot of them) sound great.  [MicroMP3]	features[+3]	Utility Its got a huge list of features including an FM Recorder a Calender and contacts list. [MicroMP3]	recorded[+3]	The songs recorded with FM are as good as the original signal. [MicroMP3]	software[-1]	Software The software that comes along with it is not very intuitive but once you are used to it,it  does the job well. [MicroMP3]	playlists[+3]	Creating and modifying playlists is easy and clean.  [MicroMP3]	battery life[-2]	There are 2 things that need fixing  First is the battery life. It will run for 6 hrs without problems with medium usage of the buttons. [MicroMP3]	USB[-2]	Second might be a problem I might have with my PC but not too sure, when the player is connected on the USB and I start playing on it and also using the windows explorer, it sometimes pauses by itself and tries to synchronise with the PC during play, which is a bit irritating.     [MicroMP3]	creative zen[+2]	I think that for its price compared to the ipod the creative zen is pretty good.  [MicroMP3]	headphone jack[-3]	HOWEVER after just one month my headphone jack was BROKEN as a result of normal, every-day use.  [MicroMP3]	support[+3]	The good news is that the creative support is very responsive and after some emails and postal exchanges, i had a new zen.  [MicroMP3]	organization[-2][u]	i dont especially like how music files are unstructured; basically they are just dumped into one folder with no organization, like you might have in windows explorer folders and subfolders.  [MicroMP3]	sound[+1]	the sound is quite good, in terms of volume.  [MicroMP3]	headphones[-2]	the headphones are not very comfortable, but most people have a certain style they like so just go buy new ones or keep the ones you have.  [MicroMP3]	installation[+2], touch pad[+1]	i didnt have any installation problems; and the touch pad is fine, even if it is sort of inaccurate.  [MicroMP3]	cheaper[+2][u],WMA files[+2][u]	i didnt get ipod because i dont especially like itunes (no music i want, but thats just me) and the creative product was cheaper; and i needed to be able to use WMA files.  [MicroMP3]	price[+2][p]	all-in-all, its good enough for its price as long as it doesnt break again due to normal use.       [MicroMP3]	software[-2], feature[-2][u]	The Creative MediaSource software that comes with the Zen Micro is cluttered, and excludes my favorite feature in iTunes, the ability to automatically copy everything you import into a certain folder. [MicroMP3]	Player[-1]	NAGATIVES of the Player itself:  You need to do a little work before having full enjoyement of this player.  [MicroMP3]	sensitivy[-1]	Even on the LOW sensitivy level, a slight touch can skip or pause the track.  [MicroMP3]	player[-2]	This fixes some glitches such as the player freezing.    [MicroMP3]	battery[+2]	The battery is removable. [MicroMP3]	FM radio[+1]	 FM radio built in (Howard Stern).  [MicroMP3]	microphone[+1]	Record memos using the built in microphone.  [MicroMP3]	looks[+2]	The player looks SO much better when you're actually holding it. [MicroMP3]	back[+2]	The back of the player is nice too, with water ripples inside the clear white coating.  [MicroMP3]	storage[+2]	You can use it as a storage Hard Drive.    [MicroMP3]	iTunes[+1]	I have no problem using iTunes with the Zen Micro (in a makeshift sorta way).   [MicroMP3]	made[-3][u]	First thing I noticed was that the creative wasn't well made. [MicroMP3]	player[-3]	One drop from a pocket or desktop, and it'd be a goner.  [MicroMP3]	sound[-3]	 Problems with the sound quality were evident right away, but even I couldn't imagine they'd be that bad. [MicroMP3]	eq[-3], bass[-3]	The eq is awful, and even at top volumes, the bass is flat sounding. [MicroMP3]	volume [-1]	Cranking the master volume level up past the mark of the bar only leads to distortion and compromised sound quality. [MicroMP3]	headphone jack[-3]	The headphone jack gave out after only a couple weeks of use, and the stock earbuds were replaced same day with some high end sony's I'd been having. [MicroMP3]	sound[-2]	If you've been listening to cd's in your car for awhile, dealing with the drop-off in sound quality may take some getting used to. [MicroMP3]	car adapter[+2]	However, if there was one thing I liked about the creative, it would be the car adapter. [MicroMP3]	storage[-2][u]	Even after all the nightmare sound problems, I'd still half-way like this product if it kept it's promise; the ability to store 1500 songs. [MicroMP3]	storage[-2][u]	I got about 700 loaded up before it told me I was full, and at that point, I was ready to toss it out the window.   [MicroMP3]	creative[-][cc]	My friend has an ipod, and although the sound quality probably won't meet most audiophile standards, the product itself is better than anything creative has made.[MicroMP3]	compatibility with windows media player[+3]	While they all seem to have their own positives and negatives, I picked the Zen Micro over the Ipod mini, because I am not an Apple person, never has been - I wanted something that is fully compatible with Windows Media Player. [MicroMP3]	format[+2]	Also, the WMA compression format is superior to MP3, especially at lower bit rates, so I needed a player that could handle WMA and integrate well with my Windows XP computers.  [MicroMP3]	accessories[+3]	I was fortunate to get the packaging that still included all the accessories (desk stand/hard case, belt clip, wall charger, etc). [MicroMP3]	Zen Micro[+3]	And so far, I have been very, very happy with my Zen Micro. [MicroMP3]	working[+3][u]	It's being used daily and I have had none of the problems reported by other reviewers (headphone jack, player locking up, etc). [MicroMP3]	features[+3], user interface[+3]	The Micro has an impressive array of very nice features and a well designed user interface. [MicroMP3]	feel[+3]	What I like the most:  - Small and solid feel. [MicroMP3]	size[+2],feel[+2]	The Zen Micro is smaller than it looks in pictures, and feels very solid. [MicroMP3]	backlight[+3]	The blue backlight is pretty cool. [MicroMP3]	screen[+2], touchpad[+2]	The screen is clear and readable, and the touch pad works very well, it took me less than a day to get the hang of it, and now I like it better than having to click buttons or fiddle with a separate volume control.  [MicroMP3]	sound[+3], audio quality[+3]	- Great sound! I was very impressed, I encode at 192 kbps and the audio quality is great, especially with the better headphones. [MicroMP3]	transfer[+2], sync with media player[+1][u]	The first thing I did was upgrade the firmware to the version required for WMP10, it syncs flawlessly with Media Player and transfers are fast.  [MicroMP3]	battery[+1]	- Replaceable battery. [MicroMP3]	interface[+2][u]	With the right firmware, drag and drop to and from the player like any other jump drive.  [MicroMP3]	player[+3][p]	I have not yet used all the features, like the calendar, etc, but as a music player this little thing rocks.  [MicroMP3]	battery life[-2]	The only reason for not giving it 5 stars: the claimed battery life of 12 hours is very optimistic - possible maybe if you really sit down and listen continuously for 12 hours without ever touching the player, but in real life I can probably get 6-8 hours at most. [MicroMP3]	battery life[-2]	Even the "shorter" battery life, though, has not impaired my positive experience with the Zen Micro in any way. [MicroMP3]	warranty price[+2][u], accessories[+2], player[+][s]	If you can get one with all the accessories and a cheap extended warranty, this is the player to get! Highly recommended.     [MicroMP3]	price[+2]	The Micro seeemed like an iPod for less. [MicroMP3]	sound[+3]	Pros: - Excellent sound, even with the headphones that come out of the box, but it absolutely rocked with my Bose Quietcomfort 2 set. [MicroMP3]	look[+3], size[+3][u]	- Looks sleek, compact, has a radio.  [MicroMP3]	accessories[-2]	Limitations: - Not a lot of original accessories like the iPod. [MicroMP3]	battery life[-2]	- The battery life leaves a lot to be desired. [MicroMP3]	firmware[-3]	I downloaded the new firmware which was supposed to take care of the problem, but it hasn't worked. [MicroMP3]	touchpad[-1]	I occassionally flip songs while working out as i accidently hit the pad even lightly (yes i have it in maximum desensitized mode). [MicroMP3]	audible.com book compatibility[-3][u]	- Not compatible with Audible.com books.  [MicroMP3]	Zen Micro[-2]	Overall, it does its basic function very well, but we expect more from the mp3 players today and the Zen Micro does not rise to the occassion.     [MicroMP3]	player[+3][p]	Don't worry this player rocks.  [MicroMP3]	appeal[+3]	It was also the most appealing.   [MicroMP3]	packing[+3][u]	For the Zen Creative focused on packaging which looked well thought out, well presented and easy to open and put back together.  [MicroMP3]	casing[+3]	It has a cardboard slip cover with a nice layered box casing inside.  [MicroMP3]	case[+3]	A distinct IPod relation is evident with white colored cables, power plug and the very nice Zen case with a white rubber inside covering.  [MicroMP3]	design[+3]	I do give create to Creative for their attractive design.    [MicroMP3]	functionality[+2]	Creative has put a lot of effort into making this player appeal to those true geeks that search for coolness and functionality in electronic devices. [MicroMP3]	player[+1][p]	Creative was defiantly giving the IPod a run for their money with this device.  [MicroMP3]	player[+][p][cs]	It makes the Nomad I purchase feel and look like junk.  [MicroMP3]	quality[+2]	Everything shines of quality.  [MicroMP3]	player[+1][cs]	I was more excited about this player upon opening than I was about the Nomad.  [MicroMP3]	accessories[+2]	I am now staring at an array of stuff including Zen Micro player, stereo earbud headphones, a rechargeable lithium-ion battery, an AC/DC power adapter, a USB 2.0 cable, a belt-clip, a stand, a stylish cloth pouch, an installation CD, a quick-start guide, and Creative MediaSource software.  [MicroMP3]	interface[+3]	The interface works great.  [MicroMP3]	touchpad[+2]	I enjoy getting use to the touch pad. [MicroMP3]	navigation[+2]	In minutes I was easily navigating through the menus.  [MicroMP3]	sound[+3]	What impressed me most was the sound.  [MicroMP3]	sound[+3]	At 128 the songs sound very good.  [MicroMP3]	audio quality[+2]	The Zen lives up to the audio quality I love and expect.  [MicroMP3]	headphones[+2]	The Earbuds are great headphones as good as my AGK Studio 240, well not as good but darn close.  [MicroMP3]	Zen[+][s]	The Zen was an impressive purchase and I would highly recommend it to anyone using Napster.  [MicroMP3]	player[+3][p]	I absolutely love it. [MicroMP3]	size[+3]	It's so small. [MicroMP3]	look[+3]	It looks sleek and modern. [MicroMP3]	storage[+3]	It holds plenty of songs. [MicroMP3]	sound[+3]	The sound is amazing. [MicroMP3]	menu[+2]	The menu is easy to use and understand. [MicroMP3]	touchpad controls[+2]	I love the touchpade controls. [MicroMP3]	touchpad controls[+2][p]	They're easy to use. [MicroMP3]	radio[+2], voice recording[2]	The radio and voice recording are nice. [MicroMP3]	headphones[+2]	The earbud headphones are really nice. [MicroMP3]	batterylife[+2]	The battery has a long life. [MicroMP3]	battery replacement[+2]	It's rechargable and supposedly easy to replace though I haven't had to do it yet of course. [MicroMP3]	file transfer/rip software[+2]	The file ripping/transfering software that comes with the player is easy to use. [MicroMP3]	file transfer[+2][p][cc]	It's faster than WMP. [MicroMP3]	player[+1]	So far I have no complaints with this player. [MicroMP3]	player[+][s]	If anyone is thinkning of getting an ipod mini, forget it and go with this player. [MicroMP3]	price[+2], storage[+2], size[+2]	It's cheaper, holds more songs and is smaller.      [MicroMP3]	storage[+2][u]	I have stored 40 audio CDs and i still have close to 2.8 GB free.   [MicroMP3]	software[+2]	User Interface: The software is simple and straight forward. [MicroMP3]	PC  software[-2]	PC software that comes with the player is not as simple as i Tunes but its not bad at all. [MicroMP3]	scroll bar[-1]	The scrol bar agian takes some getting used to. [MicroMP3]	storage [+2][u]	You can use the player to store your computer data files (Good feature to have).   [MicroMP3]	Battery[+3]	Battery : A Big Big plus. [MicroMP3]	battery usage[+2][u]	Most of the other players I checked dont have user servicable battery. [MicroMP3]	battery life[+2][u]	Each battery lasts about 10-11 hours. [MicroMP3]	battery charging[+2][u]	Another good feature is that you can charge the battery by just connecting the player to your computer using the USB cable.  [MicroMP3]	FM tuner[+2]	FM tuner & Microphone : Having a tuner in the player is a blessing. [MicroMP3]	FM reception[-2][u]	Since zen does not have an external antena it has some problems catching weak signals but it works. [MicroMP3]	microphone[+3]	Builtin microphone is great for recording short voice notes. [MicroMP3]	sound[+3]	Sound: This is where I love Zen the most. [MicroMP3]	sound[+3]	Excellent sound I mean the player has juice. [MicroMP3]	bass[+3], treble[+3]	The bass treble the sound detail is awsome. [MicroMP3]	player[+][cc]	I compared it to other CD players (Two models of Panasonic, Rio & samsung) and they were no way even near Zen Micro.  [MicroMP3]	look[+2]	Looks and shape: I have a black one and the first time I charged it and switched it on jeez the blue light looked so cool. [MicroMP3]	size[+2]	Its compact and has rounded edges. [MicroMP3]	size[+1]	Fits well in hand in trouser pockets.   [MicroMP3]	belt clip[+1], stand[+1]	Freebies you get: A cradle with detachable stand and belt clip, some thing very handy and useful. [MicroMP3]	belt clip[-1], design[-2]	I dont use the belt clip cuz it fails to hold the player securely (design problem). [MicroMP3]	headphones[-3], accessories[+2]	You get a USB cable headphones, a pouch, software except headphones you will like every thing else.  [MicroMP3]	headphones[-2], beltclip design[-2]	What I dont like: Nothing much except Headphones, Belt clip design. [MicroMP3]	sound[+2]	FM transmitter (belkin has a good one) to use Zen with your car Sterio FM Tunner   Latest Find: Connected this baby to my $3800 audiophile audio system and it produced clean sound compared to Ipod. [MicroMP3]	player[+2][u]	Thankfully, Creative has come through with a product that puts the Ipod back in its place.  [MicroMP3]	Zen micro[+2]	While I have not had the "privilege", as many call it, of owning an Ipod, based on the experience of friends who have had some misfortune with their Ipod (and subsequently purchased the Zen Touch or Zen Micro), I can pretty much rest assured that my decision to purchase the Zen Micro was one of the more informed ones.[MicroMP3]	player[+2]	By focusing exclusively on quality rather than excessive marketing, they have introduced a player that can look the Ipod straight in the eye and not flinch.  [MicroMP3]	Zen micro[+][s]	While I'm not too keen on their customer service (none of the products I have from Creative have given me issues), I can definitely recommend the Zen Micro for the simple fact that it does exactly what it is supposed to do and more...without needing any of the extra hype except word of mouth.  [MicroMP3]	look[+2][u], size[+2], battery life[+2]	About the product:  The Zen Micro is a sleek, stylish device that caters not just to "hip" youngsters but to people of all walks of life who like to listen on the go without having to worry frequently about battery life, size, or the "awkward" factor.  [MicroMP3]	size[+2], design{+3],	It fits comfortably in my shirt pocket and while very well-designed, doesn't look to ostentatious while I'm walking around with it.  [MicroMP3]	interface[+1]	The interface, while a bit confusing at first, is very easy to navigate after about 15 minutes.  [MicroMP3]	battery life[+3]	Battery life is exceptional, lasting longer than the 8-10 hours that seem reasonable with most music players on the market.  [MicroMP3]	file transfer[+2][u], software[+2]	Transferring files couldn't be easier thanks to the included software bundle.  [MicroMP3]	organizer[+2],software[+2]	Also, I am quite partial to the Creative MediaSource Organizer and Player software, which I had with Audigy ZS sound card originally; it is definitely an added plus.  [MicroMP3]	design[+2], features[+2]	All-in-all, Creative has definitely come up with a winner in terms of product design and features, and I look forward to the Nomad/Zen line of products seizing more market share as people begin to realize that quality is a better determinant of experience than quantity and hype.  [MicroMP3]	configuration[-1][u]	P.S.  The only snag I encountered while initially configuring the device was trying to hook up the Micro to a front USB port.  The bus for the front port on my motherboard did not have enough power; after connecting it to the rear ports, it works perfectly.     [MicroMP3]	look[+2], player[-2][p]	This device looks pretty nice but it's really not very competitive.  [MicroMP3]	player[-][cc]	The iPod mini is smaller and sexier, albeit limited in supported formats and the Rio Karma is a far better value.  [MicroMP3]	storage[-][cc], format[-2][cc]	The karma is only $5 more, it's small, had a 20 gig drive and supports more formats including ogg.  [MicroMP3]	look[+][cc], interface[-2]	The karma doesn't look as sexy but it's interface is very efficiently designed.  [MicroMP3]	functioning[+1]	Initially, I was very impressed, after loading 180 songs it seemed to function very well but then it would lock up on me and a battery removal remedied this, I then downloaded the upgrades and everything seemed to be alright. [MicroMP3]	auto load[-2]	After a week I tried to load some more songs and delete a few but the auto load didn't do anything but turn on my player. [MicroMP3]	software[-3]	It seems like the software is just not responding. [MicroMP3]	support[-3]	The support has been less than impressive, considering the cost. [MicroMP3]	support[-3][u]	I'm going to try to get a refund but considering all the hoops I jumped through (emails, downloads, reboots, a purge and another download, plus reading through the help menu) a refund should be twice as frustrating.     [MicroMP3]	storage[+2], battery[+2], features[+2][u]	The extra GB of hardrive space, removeable battery and FM tuner, as well as the fact that I was previously a satisfied owner of the Nomad II put it over the top for me. [MicroMP3]	working[+2]	Fortunately for me, I have yet to have a single problem with this player.  [MicroMP3]	interface[+2], controls[+2]	I think the OS and controls are very well thought out and although I'll admit I was a bit intimidated during my first few hours with the Micro, the interface and controls became second nature after the first day or so. [MicroMP3]	manual[+1]	However, there is a more detailed PDF manual on the CD (and online) that should answer any questions about the operational features of the Zen Micro. [MicroMP3]	software[-2]	While the software may not be as easy as I-Tunes, it is not difficult to use by any stretch. [MicroMP3]	loading speed[+2]	As opposed to the Nomad II or any other flash based player, the songs load extremely fast...about one or two seconds per song. [MicroMP3]	editing titles[+1]	I also like the fact that you can edit your MP3 titles, etc. [MicroMP3]	sound[+2]	After comparing the included Creative earbuds directly against my Sony MD-E828LP's and Sennheiser MX-400's, I find myself still using the Creative's, which in my opinion, sound every bit as good and have a slightly longer cord.  [MicroMP3]	FM reception[-2]	If I was pressed to find a negative aspect of the Zen Micro I would probably have to mention weak FM reception, but the building where I primarily use the Micro seems to have a history of terrible radio reception anyway, so you can take that for what it's worth.  [MicroMP3]	functioning[-3]	It had issues right off the bat, with freezing up, staying in 'SHUTTING DOWN' mode, and just not functioning very well in general. [MicroMP3]	touch pad[-2], access[-2]	The touch-pad would be a great thing if it worked well, and as I never had issues getting songs transferred to the player, I did have problems accessing them from the player.   [MicroMP3]	make[-3][u]	Many other reviewers are mentioning that they have had no problems at all> I would say that the main problem is that this player is just not made very well. [MicroMP3]	player[-3][u]	It is the 'first generation' of the player, and while I still agree that it is a great alternative to the iPod, I think there are many others that would be a much better value for your buck.   [MicroMP3]	player[-][s]	If someone asked me flat out, i'd say to go woth something else.      [MicroMP3]	price[+1], design[+1]	Perhaps I bought the Micro to be different, the cheaper price tag (from Amazon), the design, or avoiding the high iPod theft in NYC subways. [MicroMP3]	player[+2][p]	Whichever it may be, I'm happy I've made this purchase.  [MicroMP3]	size[+2]	When I opened the box, I was shocked by the size of this thing... It's TINY! [MicroMP3]	look[+2][u], size[+2][u]	It's shorter, sleeker, more compact and fits comfortably in my small hand than the iPod...My Nokia cell phone towers over this bad boy! [MicroMP3]	interface[+1], trim[+1]	The interface has a sassier flair and the blue-lit trimming is an added bonus. [MicroMP3]	sound[+1]	Moving on to sound department... It delivers! [MicroMP3]	earbuds[+1], bass[-2]	The earbuds, on the other hand, are decent in sound, but lacking in bass. [MicroMP3]	earbuds[-1]	I've since replaced it with a pair of black Sennheisers... Not only are the packaged earbuds pretty uncomfortable, but are too similar to iPod's and can target iPod theives here in NYC. [MicroMP3]	functionality[+2], navigation[+2], touchpad[-1]	Functionality, menus are easy to navigate... As many have mentioned, the touch pads take some time to get used to, but I've gotten used to it. [MicroMP3]	design[-1]	Although, I thought it could've been designed a bit better.  [MicroMP3]	extra features[+1]	There are extra features packed inside this unit (some that most will hardly ever use) such as FM radio tuner, voice recorder, calendar, and alarm clock. [MicroMP3]	battery usage[+1][u]	Speaking of battery, it's removable AND replaceable! [MicroMP3]	Micro[+2]	Overall, the Micro is a solid device and I haven't fell into a problem with it yet *knocks on wood*. [MicroMP3]	storage[-1][u]	It's perfect for those who aren't planning on storing tons of music. [MicroMP3]	music transfer[+1]	Transferring music is a breeze. I don't subscribe to music services, but as mentioned on other reviews, Micro allows you to subscribe to services OTHER than iTunes. [MicroMP3]	features[+2], sound quality[+2]	It may not top the iPod Mini, but it's definitely an alternative if you also want the extra features and good sound quality.  [MicroMP3]	design[+2], size[+2][u], comfort[+2][u], look[+2]	Strong Points: - Design: small, comfortable, curved, and stylish. [MicroMP3]	sound[+3]	You don't need to cough up an extra couple bucks for a "special edition" to get black! - Sound: Awesome! - Batteries: removable/replaceable. [MicroMP3]	audio formats[+2]	- Audio Formats: supports both MP3, WMA... And yeah, WAV too.  [MicroMP3]	FM reception[-2][u]	- Radio Quality: weak reception     [MicroMP3]	look[-3][u], storage[+1]	It's nice that the Zen Micro has bells and whistles like FM (but where's AM???) and voice recording, and 20% more storage than "the other" mini MP3 player, but why is it so (...)ugly?  [MicroMP3]	color[-2], touchpad[-2]	The colors are a joke, and I personally hate the stupid vertical touchpad. [MicroMP3]	design[-3]	But my biggest gripe is still the extremely ugly design.  [MicroMP3]	audio[+2], player[-3][u]	What's the point of having "good audio" in your hand when your g/f thinks you have no taste whatsoever and your friends laugh their heads off while proudly showing off their iPod Mini?  [MicroMP3]	software[-3]	Still has terrible software.  [MicroMP3]	software[-3][p]	You have to wonder why Creative can't get this right.  [MicroMP3]	look[+2], controls[-3], touchpad[-2][u]	Looks nice but the conrols are awkward and the entire front is touch sensitive.  [MicroMP3]	storage[+2][u]	You do get 1 more GB than an iPod mini.  [MicroMP3]	screen review[-2]	Screen review could be better.  [MicroMP3]	screen review[-][cc]	Apple stil does it better but needs to come out with a 5 gig mini.     [MicroMP3]	player[+3][p]	This product is amazing and better than the Ipod you can get at the same price. [MicroMP3]	storage[+1], cost[+1]	the 4G Ipod costs the same as this 5G Zen Micro. [MicroMP3]	features[+2][u]	It also has a voice recorder and FM radio that you can only get on an Ipod if you but an adapter seperately. [MicroMP3]	design[+3]	Creative did an awesome job with the design. [MicroMP3]	headphones[+2], extra accessories[+2][u]	The headphones have great sound and durability and mine came with some extras when I bought it (a stand, a belt hook, charger) that I know doesn't come with every one. [MicroMP3]	player[+2][p]	I have the black one and adore it. [MicroMP3]	look[+2], background light[+3]	It looks nice and sleek and the blue background light looks awesome against the black. [MicroMP3]	size[+1], style[+1]	I bought my Zen Micro three months ago mainly because I preferred the size and style to the iPod mini. [MicroMP3]	player[+2]	Overall, I've been very impressed with the player. [MicroMP3]	functioning[+2][u]	I've had almost no problems with the firmware (ie, lock-ups, shut-downs etc), but I have kept the player up to date. [MicroMP3]	firmware[+1]	I'm not sure whether this is related to the charge cycle of its Li-Ion battery, the better firmware, or a combination of both factors. [MicroMP3]	battery life[+2][u]	I imagine if I left my player untouched (no backlight) it could play for considerably more than 12 hours at a low volume level.  [MicroMP3]	sync to windows media player[+1]	One of my favorite features about the player is its ability to sync to Windows Media Player. [MicroMP3]	speed[+2][u], look[+2]	Its just as fast as the included Creative software, but much less invasive, and overall better looking. [MicroMP3]	touchpad[+2]	The touchpad is great once you get used to it, and I much prefer it to standard buttons or scroll wheels (as on the Dell DJ for example). [MicroMP3]	touchpad[2][p]	They are sensitive and accurate (perhaps too accurate, it senses through t-shirt cloth, but the touchpad can be locked), but easy to clean, unlike buttons. [MicroMP3]	touchpad[+1]	Also, the touchpad seems to be waterproof to some degree.  [MicroMP3]	FM reception[-2]	The FM radio's reception isn't spectacular, but it will pick up the most powerful stations in any given metro area. [MicroMP3]	radio record[+1]	Its ability to record radio is useful as well, but would have been moreso if it could be preset.  [MicroMP3]	look[+3], feel[+3], sound[+3]	The player looks great, feels great, and sounds great. [MicroMP3]	durability[+2]	So far it has been very durable (other than the little pads on the earbuds), but those aren't really necessary as I find them comfortable on their own. [MicroMP3]	earbuds[+2][p][cc]	They also sound excellent compared to other earbuds including retail sets like Panasonics and Sennheisers. [MicroMP3]	Zen micro[+2]	This year, it seems that I choose my timing perfectly, having discovered the awesome device that is the Zen Micro.  [MicroMP3]	features[+2][p]	Everything that I have listed above, the Zen has, and more. [MicroMP3]	navigation[+3][u]	The menus are easy to scroll through; they are laid out naturally, and make sense. [MicroMP3]	interface[+2]	The computer interface is 90% good, only losing points due to the fact that "Creative" branding is all over the place within it. [MicroMP3]	transfer speed[+3], battery life[+3]	Songs transfer lightning fast, and the two batteries that came in my box give me 24 hours of listen time. [MicroMP3]	features[+2]	On the fly play list creation, address book, removable storage drive capabilities, sound recorder, the list goes on people, this thing is literally so chalked full of goodies, it was like Halloween all over again. [MicroMP3]	design[+3], ease ofuse[+2]	So far I have used all of the above-mentioned features, and find them well designed, and easy to understand.  [MicroMP3]	Zen[-2]	00% good though, and the Zen does have a few drawbacks. [MicroMP3]	file transfer[-2]	While transferring songs to the player, the interface has crashed a few times (4-5 times in a 4-5 hour period) normally this would cause me major concern, but it appears that this bug is reproducible, which leads me to believe that Creative will fix it with a patched version shortly (or maybe it's just my computer). [MicroMP3]	response speed[-1][u]	Another thing I don't like is that some of the features take 1-2 seconds to load up. [MicroMP3]	plaeyr[+][s]	That's it for now, what are you doing still reading this, click the "Add to Cart" button already!      [MicroMP3]	features[+][cc], sound quality[+2], music source support[+2]	Right out of the box, I loved it, better features than the Ipod, great sound quality and no limitations on what music sources I can use. [MicroMP3]	player[+3][p]	So, I was one who was ready to give it 5 stars with no complaints at all. [MicroMP3]	warranty[-1]	After consulting with Creative's customer support, they determined that the hard drive was broken and the only recourse was to send it in for repair, which would cost me $40, since it's past the 90 day warranty (pretty short warranty). [MicroMP3]	working[-2]	Well, I got my second player, and right out of the box it wasn't working right and once again, after consulting customer se![MicroMP3]	quality[-2], reliability[-2]	They obviously have quality and reliability problems. [MicroMP3]	player[-][s]	They have a good concept here, and I normally expect a lot better quality from Creative, so maybe they will do better with the next gen version, but for now I say buyer beware.  [MicroMP3]	player[+2][p]	ORIGINAL REVIEW December 2004 I'm sorry to read about other people having problems with their Zen Micro, but mine has worked great! [MicroMP3]	player[+2][p]	This is my first MP3 player and I am so impressed with what such a small device can do.  [MicroMP3]	sound[+3], rip[+2]	I have ripped over 100 songs from my CD collection and it was so easy and fast, and they all sound great.  [MicroMP3]	interface[-1]	es, the interface took a little getting used to, but once I did, it's almost second nature now.  [MicroMP3]	organization[+2][u]	I love that you can create custom playlists, and organize music in so many different ways.  [MicroMP3]	WAV format[-3]	Only slight negatives I've had so far is that I haven't been able to get it to accept any of my WAV files yet.  [MicroMP3]	case[-2]	My other nit is that it didn't include at least some kind of carrying case for everything.  [MicroMP3]	belt clip[-1]	Yes, there is a belt clip, but that doesn't hold the extra battery and usb cable.  [MicroMP3]	bag[-3]	The little bag it comes with is cheap and useless.  [MicroMP3]	bag[-2]	It barely holds anything and mine just puts a bunch of thread fuzzies all over the player, because the bag is cheap and seems to be coming apart.  [MicroMP3]	player[+][s]	I love my dark blue zen micro and would definitely recommend it.  [MicroMP3]	player[-2]	It is not a perfect product but it does have a lot going for it.  [MicroMP3]	features[+2]	The FM tuner, the 5G of storage, and the removable disk are all great features.  [MicroMP3]	look[2]	The fit and finish of the product is first-rate.  [MicroMP3]	interface[-1]	On the downside, I think the interface takes some getting used to and the Zen software ![MicroMP3]	software[-2][p]	is not as intuitive as I would like.  [MicroMP3]	earbuds[-1]	Also, the earbuds that came with it sound great but are uncomfortable (although my wife didn't have a problem), so I bought a pair of over-the-ear headphones.  [MicroMP3]	player[+2][p]	Overall, I am very pleased with it.  [MicroMP3]	player[+2][p]	The more I use it and figure out how to do things, the more I like it.     [MicroMP3]	sound quality[+3]	Before you run out and buy an iPod, understand something: there are REASONS the Zen is worth encountering this kind of hassle, principally excellent (for MP3) sound quality.  [MicroMP3]	headphones[+][cc]	The supplied headphones are hands-down better than the mediocre iPod buds. [MicroMP3]	size[+2][u]	The player is smaller than you think. [MicroMP3]	touchpad[-2]	The touch pad is over-sensitive, and is adjustable to only slightly oversensitive. [MicroMP3]	sound quality[+3], music subscription service[+2]	Bottom line: If you value excellent sound quality and the ability to use music subscription services, and are willing to deal with the possibility (not the certainty) of setup gremlins, by all means get the Zen Micro.     [MicroMP3]	software[-3]	The machine itself seems fine, but the software that came with it is AWFUL. [MicroMP3]	player[-2]	After installation, the very first time I booted up the Creative MediaSource Organizer, intending to use its CD burning and ripping functions, it totally shorted out. [MicroMP3]	working[-2]	I was up all night trying to make the stupid thing work, to no avail. [MicroMP3]	customer support[-3]	Of course one of the first things I did was write an email to the customer support at Creative, through their website, and by the time they finally got back to me - several working days later when they promise only one - their suggestions were completely worthless. [MicroMP3]	player[-3]	his is what I get for my $200 on this MP3 player?  [MicroMP3]	Zen micro[+2]	The Zen Micro is near perfect.   [MicroMP3]	built[+3][u]	It's still alive, still kicking, and still playing.   [MicroMP3]	windows compatibility[+2][u]	The Zen Micro (mine's black) has a lot going for it.   [MicroMP3]	size[+2][u], sound quality[+3], interface[+2][u], look[+2][u], battery[+1], features[+2]	It fits into a hand well, it has a removable battery (this is important), great sound quality, fm stereo, recorder, smooth UI, and a feature that most unipods lack... char![MicroMP3]	work with WMP[-2]	It wouldn't always work seemlessly with WMP and it often required me to restart the frozen micro by taking out the battery and restarting it. [MicroMP3]	accessories[+3]	The accesories that come with the player are great. [MicroMP3]	bag[+1]	White earbuds ( i replaced those with some shure headphones, big difference), a case, a stand, a clip (which doesn't really work), and a nice little zen micro bag. [MicroMP3]	player[+2][p]	best in class. [MicroMP3]	player[+2][p]	It gives you the most bang for your buck, period.   [MicroMP3]	quality[+2]	Creative has been making computer sound equipment for decades and with the zen micro it finally has something with enough quality and, yes, charm to win a nice size of the digital player pie.   [MicroMP3]	player[+][s]	Pick your favorite color and buy it.      [MicroMP3]	touch sensitivity[-2]	As for the Zen Micro:\  Cons:  I read that every button is touch sensitive, and thats very annoying when all the main buttons are on the front. [MicroMP3]	durability[-2]	Putting the Micro into your pocket could trigger just about anything (unless the hold feature is improved: it asks if you want to "unhold" for every button up press) Second, I'm worried about the durability of the player. [MicroMP3]	durability[-2]	After research of other creative hard drive players, i found that most of them aren't very durable and tend to crash (read most reviews on amazon.com and see for yourself). [MicroMP3]	price[-2]	Last, i find the price a bit expensive for a product such as this. [MicroMP3]	design[+2], color[+2]	Pros The Design is very nice, and the colors are too. [MicroMP3]	features[+2]	It also has tons more features then previous creative products, and most of them are very useful such as the ability to custimize the main menu to show the stuff you want, not the default items (creativelabs.com for more on that).  [MicroMP3]	battery[+1]	The battery is also convenient, but could have been better, such as the Zen Touch's battery (but at least this one is removable).    [MicroMP3]	storage[-1][u]	Verdict:  Had I not needed something with a tad bit more space, I consider this player fair game. [MicroMP3]	player[+][s]	If you don't mind all the buttons being touch sensitive, I'd recomment buying it to try out, and also buy an extra 2 year warrenty for it (there are some offered here, for about $15 dollors I think).  [MicroMP3]	player[+2][p]	anyway, my wife got this for me for my birthday and I love the thing. [MicroMP3]	firmware[+2][p]	the program is called Gnomad and works great for me and seems to cover all the features the included windows sofware does. [MicroMP3]	look[+2],size[+2], accessories[+2][u]	+looks snazzy +smaller than a pack of smokes - easily transported +ac charger included as well as a hardshell that comes with a clip and a stand adapter +USB cable ![MicroMP3]	battery life[+3], sound quality[+3]	+Battery life is awesome IF you upgrade the firmware [requires a windows pc] OR make sure to always plug the ac adapter into the player before plugging into the outlet +Awesome sound quality... I mean it is Creative right? [MicroMP3]	navigation[+2]	+Sorts music by artist, album, genre, etc... it's easy to wade through 5 gigs of tunes to find what you're looking for. [MicroMP3]	scrollpad[-1]	It DOES take some getting used to. [MicroMP3]	charging[-1]	whatever...  on to the negatives:  -touchy about charging... you can damage the battery and seriously decrease it's life if you don't upgrade the firmware OR dont' heed the advice to always plug in the player side of the cord before plugging in the outlet side. [MicroMP3]	button functioning[-2][u]	It has the odd side effect of the buttons only partially working? [MicroMP3]	users guide[-1]	-User's guide doesn't cover a lot of important info that is covered on their website. [MicroMP3]	heat[-1][u]	) -Can't be left in the car... it immediately shuts down with an overheating error if left in a hot car for too long. [MicroMP3]	size[+1][u]	But since it's so small, it isn't a big deal to bring it with me.  [MicroMP3]	player[+][p][s]	Overall though, i'm very happy with it and highly recommend it to folks looking for a mp3 player, even if it is to pretend your not a braindead consumer giving into the marketing hype of the iPod. ;)     [MicroMP3]	Napster 2 go compatibility[+2]	I finally decided to purchase this player because it was compatible with Napster 2 Go....which is a subscription service, allowing me to download as much music as I want for a $14.95 flat fee.  [MicroMP3]	player[+2][p]	And I must say...this MP3 is very cool.  [MicroMP3]	look[+2]	It's so cute...and behind the black panel it glows in a neon blue.   [MicroMP3]	installation[+1]	After installation, which was VERY simple....I downloaded any updated software from the Creative website, before I downloaded any music.   [MicroMP3]	sound[+2]	The sound is very nice.  [MicroMP3]	lock feature[+1]	I also like the lock feature, so it makes the touch pad inactive.   [MicroMP3]	FM reception[-2]	I tried to use the FM radio option, but it doesn't seem to really pick up the stations I listen, however I am going to try it in a different location, it may have just been my residential location.   [MicroMP3]	touchpad[-2][p]	Even when I set it to low, it's still very hard for me to adjust the player to where and what I want it to do.  [MicroMP3]	player[+2]	Otherwise, I am extremely please with the Creative Zen Micro 5GB MP3 player.    [MicroMP3]	Zen micro[+2]	However after playing with it for three weeks now, I'm convinced, the Zen Micro is superior. [MicroMP3]	sound quality[+3]	I think sound quality should be the first and foremost feature, and the Zen is leaps and bounds better in sound quality, with no need to upgrade the earphones. [MicroMP3]	FM tuner[+1]	I thought the FM radio would not see much use with so many tracks avaiable to me, but its great for tuning in to TV programs at the gym while on the treadmill, concerts and programs being simulcast, NPR, and on and on. [MicroMP3]	scroll bar[-1]	I've read about the issues with the scroll bar, but they must have taken care of that now. [MicroMP3]	ease of usage[+2][u]	Mine is as easy to use as the mini without any firmware download. [MicroMP3]	size[+2], look[+2]	Its also smaller, and gets more looks. [MicroMP3]	extra features[+3]	An extra gig of room, FM radio, voice recorder, PIM applications with sync to Outlook. [MicroMP3]	player[+2][p]	This is really a no brainer. [MicroMP3]	features[+2]	I purchased this over the Ipod Mini because it had several nice features: extra 1G storage, WMA support, replaceable battery, and especially that it wasn't an Apple product with their proprietary architecture.  [MicroMP3]	touchpad[-3]	The Touchpad is virtually unusable -- sometimes you have to press like mad to make a selection and other times the slightest brush causes something to be selected that you don't want. [MicroMP3]	Outlook compatibility[+2]	Better for the Zen Micro is Outlook compatibility. [MicroMP3]	software[+3], tech support[+2], accessories[+2]	Creative has excellent music software, a very responsive tech support group (they are quick on firmware updates, and make them publicly available), and usually a good array of accessories.  [MicroMP3]	additional accesories[+1]	The Zen Micro is no exception: in addition to the case, it comes with a neck strap, and has all of the necessary cables for syncing and charging.  [MicroMP3]	extra battery{+2]	The extra spare battery is just a neat bonus.  [MicroMP3]	player[+2]	If I could, I'd trade-up on my Creative Muvo2 and snag a Zen Micro tomorrow.  [MicroMP3]	player[+2][p], portability[+2][p], size[+2][p]	This is a perfect blend to accomplish both tasks.  [MicroMP3]	plug in[+2]	I also own a retail store and this little guy easily plugs into my AUX slot in the store's sound system.  [MicroMP3]	features[+2], headphones[+2]	Feature for feature, I find it a very sweet little player; equipped with a higher end headphone system, between this and th larger Zen Ihardly use my home stereo system anymore. [MicroMP3]	Napster to go compatibility[-3]	If you buying this player to use with Napster to Go, wait a while. [MicroMP3]	firmware[-3]	A lot of people are having problems with the firmware update required to use the player for Napster to Go.. The firmware is beta and they are are a lot of bugs in it. [MicroMP3]	player[+2][p]	On the whole, I'm quite happy with the purchase.  [MicroMP3]	sound[+2], storage[+2][u]	The sound is bright and clear, the ability to store any MP3's (and not just Apple-approved files) is great, and I plan to make use of the storage space and sound recording from time to time.    [MicroMP3]	look[+3], comfort[+2], weight[+3], interface[+2]	The device looks very cool, I think (exactly as the photos promise), it's comfortable and lightweight in my jacket pocket, and the interface and controls are easy enough to navigate after a bit of practice.  [MicroMP3]	srorage[+2]	No offense to Amazon, but I was able to find one online for just over 200 bucks (I'm sure prices here will continue to sink), and that also seemed quite a good bargain for the amount of storage space.    [MicroMP3]	radio feature[+1]	I like some local stations, Stern, and NPR, and so the radio seemed like a great option.  [MicroMP3]	FM reception[-2][u]	Imagine my disappointment, though, when the Zen Micro proved able to play only the mega-strongest FM signals in my area.  [MicroMP3]	FM reception[-3][u]	It seems like you need to park yourself right next to a radio tower for the Micro to pull in a strong sound.  [MicroMP3]	battery life[-2]	The battery, as others have said, also seems weaker than Creative suggests.  [MicroMP3]	creative[-2][u]	Still, that's enough time that I'm still satisfied, if a bit grouchy with Creative's overhyped promises.    [MicroMP3]	headphones[+1]	Have not had any issues with the headphones or fragility.  [MicroMP3]	Zen micro[+2]	eball metaphor: I was hoping Creative hit a home run here, and I think the Zen Micro is more like a stand-up double.  [MicroMP3]	player[-1][u]	Respectable, solid, but not awe-inspiring.          [MicroMP3]	sound quality[+2][p], battery life[+2][p], capacity[+2][p], look[+2][p], construction[+2][p], price[+2][p], compatibility[+1][p]	Actually, the Creative Zen Micro solves all that.  [MicroMP3]	sound quality[+3]	Sound quality? Phenomenal. [MicroMP3]	sound quality[+][cc], earbuds[+2]	unarguably better than Apple's, and nice earbuds to boot.  [MicroMP3]	variety of colors[+3][u]	Your choice of ten colors in a beatiful package.  [MicroMP3]	storage[+3][u]	Five gigabytes is plenty for my great albums. [MicroMP3]	construction[+3][u]	Tough as nails. [MicroMP3]	construction[+3][u]	No skips, and it hasn't faltered once (despite your inevitable drop or two.[MicroMP3]	compatibility[+3]	Flawless. [MicroMP3]	play WMA[+2]	) No locked-in proprietary business like Apple; this baby plays WMAs too.  [MicroMP3]	voice record[+2], player[+][cc]	The voice recorder is a beautiful add-on; not even necessary, but just an example of why Apple just wants your money and Creative Labs wants to make a better player. [MicroMP3]	sound[+3]	Gets nice sound too. [MicroMP3]	FM tuner[+1]	The FM tuner is just a little spare icing on the cake.  [MicroMP3]	player[+3]	In conclusion, this player is beautiful. [MicroMP3]	ease of use[+2], power[+2]	Power for the tech-savvy, ease of use for the less fortunate. [MicroMP3]	player[+2][p]	But it; you won't regret it.     [MicroMP3]	player[+3], functioning[+2][u], touchpad[+2]	This player is absolutely phenomenal, I haven't had any problems, and if you're worried you will have problems, I suggest buying it at a retail store that has a good return policy but anyways... I find the touch pad very easy to use, and I'm surprised so many people have had problems.  [MicroMP3]	sound quality[+3][cc]	The sound quality is superb, much better than that of an iPod, in my opinion.  [MicroMP3]	radio[+3]	The radio works excellent in my area, I'm not sure everywhere else.  [MicroMP3]	software[+2], file transfer speed[+3][u]	The software is very easy to use, and the transfer is super fast!  [MicroMP3]	battery[+1], DJ[+2], features[+2]	I'm not gonna go into the features cause if you're reading this review, you've probably already looked at them, but I must say the DJ feature if Very cool and the removable battery is also a bonus!  [MicroMP3]	look[+2][u]	The blue light also makes this player one of the most fashionable in the market also.  [MicroMP3]	price[+2], player[+3]	t simply the best player on the market for a really low price, so why look anywhere else?      [MicroMP3]	player[+3][p]	I've had it for about a week now and have to say it's one of the best purchases I've ever made.  [MicroMP3]	look[+3], ease of use[+2], sound quality[+3][cc]	it's a great looking, easy-to-use device but it's the sound quality which is truly amazing -- far better than my Sony mini-disc player.  [MicroMP3]	interface[+3], touchpad[+2]	I have no problems with the touch pad (once the sensitivity is set to low) and the interface is a breeze to use without even looking at the PDF manual.  [MicroMP3]	Media player compatibility[+3]	Why bother when it works perfectly with Media Player 10?  [MicroMP3]	battery life[-1][p]	where close to 12 hours but at least it is replaceable (and they included a second one free).  [MicroMP3]	battery life[-1][p]	I would give it about 6 or 7 hours, although it will probably get better after a few charge cycles.  [MicroMP3]	storage[+2]	The extra Gb is just a bonus.  [MicroMP3]	headphones[-1]	The headphones which came with it are mediocre at best but what can you expect from a set of "ear buds".  [MicroMP3]	sound[+3]	If your looking for a great sounding mini player, you can't go wrong with the Zen Micro.     [MicroMP3]	player[-2][u]	Unfortunately I was wrong.  [MicroMP3]	player[-3]	Within one month, my player completely died. [MicroMP3]	touchpad[-3][u], buttons[-3]	(It had locked up multiple times previously, but always managed to work afterwards) This time, the touch screen wouldn't respond to me and none of the buttons worked. [MicroMP3]	working[-3][u]	So I took out the battery and put it back in again, only to find that it would not work.  [MicroMP3]	sound[-3]	I had the second one for less than two weeks when I noticed a rattling/humming/buzzing sound while music was played.  [MicroMP3]	customer service[-3]	I sent Creative customer service 3 emails in which they did not help me one bit and don't seem to even want to help.  [MicroMP3]	design[+2]	It was a good player when it worked and I loved the design.  [MicroMP3]	player[-3][p]	It's too bad, though, that ![MicroMP3]	Zen micro[+2]	The Creative Zen Micro, at first glance, is a dream come true for all mp3 and music lovers. [MicroMP3]	battery[+2][u]	The Zen offered a great alternative. [MicroMP3]	software[+1]	It's easy to use, and makes transfering your CD collection to the player a cinch. [MicroMP3]	sound quality[+2][u]	The clarity is unbelievable, which means you can cram almost the full 2,5![MicroMP3]	sound quality[+2]	Other mp3 players won't give you the sonic clarity of the Zen at this compression level, so I imagine they won't at lower ones, either. [MicroMP3]	headphones[-3]	The included headphones suck, so get your own.         [MicroMP3]	trnasfer[+2]	Transfering MP3s are a cinch with the included software. [MicroMP3]	format[+2]	The Zen plays mp3, wma and wave formats, which makes it more versatile than the Ipod. [MicroMP3]	software[+2]	The greatest thing about the software (in my humble) is that it reads your CD info. [MicroMP3]	organization[+2][u]	Track #, name, artist, album and genre is automatically-retrieved via internet-labeled, and properly catergorized into the Zen. [MicroMP3]	labling[+3]	rks almost without fail, no matter what your taste in music is: From relaxation music to hard rock, to hip hop, to Korean and Japanese, to Afro-Cuban and Salsa, Jazz, Blues, Country and Pop, this feature performs well. [MicroMP3]	touch screen[-1]	The touch sreen navigation will take a little getting used to, but once you do, and while the Zen is still alive, it's a great alternative to the marching in lock step with the click wheel commies. [MicroMP3]	FM reception[-2][u]	just too numerous to list: FM radio, which has weak reception, but at least it there, and a microphone, to name just two. [MicroMP3]	touchpad light[+2][u]	Oh, and another is the cool "halo" light that surrounds the touch pad, and light's up when you touch the screen, and how the light glows when the Zen is connected to the computer. [MicroMP3]	design[-2]	But, the Creative Zen Micro is plagued by a serious, serious stupid and elemenatary design flaw, and I'm going to tell you what it is...But first, two more things about this piece of garbage that's so great and could've made it a potenial IPOD killer.         [MicroMP3]	size[+][cc], storage[+][u][cc]	One: It's size: It's smaller than the Ipod Mini, and holds more music (5GB to the IPOD mini's 4GBs). [MicroMP3]	battery[+1]	Two: it has a removeable/rechargeable battery, so you don't have to send the thing in when the re![MicroMP3]	design[-3]	But, all of this means nothing, because of the serious, serious, stupid and ridiculously elemenatary design flaw: After 3 months, give or take a few weeks, you won't be able to hear anything. [MicroMP3]	headphone jack design[-3]	because the "engineers" at Creative screwed up the design of the headphone jack. [MicroMP3]	headphone jack[-3]	Again, the headphone jack on this thing is garbage. [MicroMP3]	headphone design[-3]	Again, this is a design flaw in the headphone![MicroMP3]	Zen[-2]	The flaw is inside the Zen. [MicroMP3]	headphone jack[-2]	The flaw is in the circuit board that the headphone jack is connected to. [MicroMP3]	Zen micro[-3]	The Creative Zen Micro is a Zen Micro killer, not an Ipod killer. [MicroMP3]	storage[-][cc]	Why would anyone buy this when you can get a 20GB iPod that will hold 4 times the number of songs (and even MORE if AAC encoding is used) for the same price???  [MicroMP3]	audio quality[+3], ease of use[+3], features[+3]	This player is fantastic in terms of audio quality, ease of use, and features. [MicroMP3]	usage with subscription service[-2][u]	To use the Creative Zen player with a subscription service, you need to go to Creative's web site, and download new software for your PC. [MicroMP3]	set up[-1]	I haven't seen any problems yet, but if you don't like to tinker a bit, this player can be a little challenging to set up.  [MicroMP3]	subscription WMA[-1]	This doesn't affect standard MP3 files - just subscription WMA files. [MicroMP3]	transfer speed[-1][u]	The subscription files are still a little slower to transfer, but it's only by about 10% or so.  [MicroMP3]	subscription DRM-encoded[-1]	Again, this doesn't affect regular MP3 files - just subscription DRM-encoded files, like those from Napster-to-Go or Yahoo Music Unlimited.  [MicroMP3]	player[+1]	Otherwise, this is a great "alternative" MP3 player for those of use who don't want to worship the mighty all-powerful Apple. [MicroMP3]	player[+2][p]	I got it to use with the new $5-per-month service from Yahoo (Music Unlimited,) and despite the above issues, I love it. [MicroMP3]	creative[+3]	I have owned some kind of Creative audio product since 1993 and have never had to call tech support.  [MicroMP3]	player[+3][p]	The main issue now is that this new Zen Micro seems to be the best on the market at least temporarily.  [MicroMP3]	interface[+2][cc], storage[+2][cc], battery life[+2][cc]	It beats Apple on the storage space, it beats apple on the removable battery (and batter life), and I personally like its interface more than the Ipod scroll wheel.  [MicroMP3]	audio quality[+][cc]	Further, the tech specs suggest that it has better audio quality than the Ipod.  [MicroMP3]	player[+3][p]	I have had several MP3 players over the past few years, and have to say that this by far is the best that I've owned. [MicroMP3]	features[+3][cc]	However, the Ipod does not come close to the number of extra features that the 'Zen Micro' has to offer.   [MicroMP3]	storage[+3][u], battery life[+3], extra features[+2][u]	Some features that the 'Zen Micro' has that sold me on my purchase include: a 5G hard drive...actually an SD flash card drive...very large and much more than actually needed, the ability to sync with Microsoft Outlook's calendar, the long battery life of about 10 to 12 hours (I can change the battery myself for about $40 to buy vs. [MicroMP3]	construction[+3], sound quality[+3], microphone[+2]	sending the unit to the company of purchase which costs about $90), the ability to record with a built-in microphone (great for recording reminders and meetings), very sturdy construction, and not to mention...the sound quality is excellent!  [MicroMP3]	user interface[+3]	As far as user interface is concerned, the best and easiest to use seems to be the one that comes with the player, 'Creative MediaSource Organizer'. [MicroMP3]	converter[+2]	This program enables the user to batch convert and convert audio files from one format to another. [MicroMP3]	formats[+3][u],	These include: MP3, Wave, WMA, WMA Pro, and WMA Lossless; it is very user-friendly simply by right-clicking the file(s) to be converted. [MicroMP3]	Creative zen Micro[+3][p]	By far this seems to be the best value out there for the money; if you are undecided, the Creative Zen Micro seems to be the best choice.     [MicroMP3]	on[-3], off[-3]	I don't know, maybe I got a defective one but first, the player would not shut off, next, the player would not come on - I had to send it away to get repaired.  [MicroMP3]	ear phone jack[-3]	Now, the player's ear phone jack is not working - I have to send it away again.  [MicroMP3]	player[+1][p]	When it's working, it's great but it is very tempermental.   [norton]	software[-3]	I have read the installation instructions for both NIS 2004 and NAV 2004 prior to installation, but still ended up with the same result...junk software.[norton]	Norton products[-3]	But if I installed either one of these Norton products, neither works after installation?[norton]	McAfee Anti-Virus 8[+2]]	It can not be the computer or the owner, since I purchased McAfee Anti-Virus 8 and it installs and works fine with no problems.[norton]	Norton[-2]	I have used Norton for the past 5 years and for the last 2 years, the software has gotten more and more disgraceful.[norton]	Norton[-2]	I am glad that I do not work for Norton.[norton]	Installation[-2]	After 4 attempted installs, I have finally given up.[norton]	NIS[-2]	During install, NIS would either freeze or not reboot properly when asked to do so.[norton]	Manual shutdown[-2]	The MS scandisk would appear due to manual shutdown and would only scan to the 2nd bar, over and over(up to 1 hr, I then shut it down and used GOBACK).[norton]	product[-3],uninstall[+2]	The 1 time it did install, it did not work and had errors, I used the unistall NIS icon and it properly removed itself.[norton]	Norton[-3]	I have never had this problem with any other software on my computer.[norton]	NIS 2003[+2]	NIS 2003 worked like a charm last year.[norton]	Norton[-3]	Being a past Norton customer, I consider this to be a slap to my face.[norton]	installed[-2]	Buying software that can not be installed normally and being put into the position of having a non-working computer.[norton]	Norton[-3]	Norton has been on a downhill slid recently with their products, but with this one, they have fallen off the cliff.[norton]	product[-3]	As a loyal customer of Norton/Symantec products, I purchased Internet Security 2004 as a software firewall and could not be any more dissatisfied with the product (and hence the one star rating).[norton]	program[-3]	Yeah - this program protects your computer all right - by locking you off the internet.[norton]	Anti-Spam	Anti-Spam is Good[norton]	antispam function[2]	The latest of Internet Security has antispam function that is helpful because I has received a mountain of those these days.[norton]	updates[-2]	Other than that it is all the same except the new updates.[norton]	Symantec softwares [+2]	But that is good for me because Symantec softwares are a bit hard to master for me who are not savvy on computers.[norton]	scandisk[-1]	So far I haven't had so much complaints except that I still haven't mastered how to scandisk when using Internet Security.[norton]	product[-2]	Too bad the product is cumbersome and intertwined trying to do so much at one time.[norton]	suite[-2]	Sometimes a suite is not a good deal and all you get is a bundle of headaches.[norton]	speed[+1]	I'm not sure why all the bad reviews, my computer isn't especially slowed down and I have Win'98.[norton]	speed[+1]	Sure, it slows it down a little, but that's expected.[norton]	Semantic[+1]	Perhaps Semantic could work out the efficiency a little, but these reviews are highly exagerated... I would ask what else these people are running on their computers(?)[norton]	NIS2004[-2]	Norton Internet Security 2004 is one of the more buggy implementations.[norton]	installation[-2]	This product has virtually all the same installation problems.[norton]	product[-1]	For purposes of clarity, here is my review from that product,edited to be appropriate for this product, since, for the most part, they share many of the same problems.[norton]	SystemWorks[+3], Internet Security[+3]	This is the fourth version of SystemWorks and the second version of Internet Security that I have used and it has always been a favorite.[norton]	antivirus[2]	The antivirus feature is phenomenal, and is regularly updated.[norton]	antivirus[2]	I think their antivirus software was one of, if not the best, on the[norton]	Internet Security 2004[-3]	This version of Internet Security 2004, is beyond hope.[norton]	install[-3], function[-2]	They are a royal pain to install, and don't function properly once finally installed -- if you can install them at all.[norton]	installation[-3]	The biggest problem is the installation.[norton]	installed[-2],LiveUpdate[-1], System Works[-1], Internet Security[-1]	Also if you do manage to get it installed, any problems with LiveUpdate or with System Works will also affect the functionality and/or the process of updating Internet Security.[norton]	product[-3]	I've had to install and uninstall them four or five times so far, and I've not to get either product working properly.[norton]	installation[-3]	First, it serious, serious installation problems.[norton]	install[-3]	Back in May 2004, when I first reviewed this, it had taken me over 16 hours to install and run.[norton]	LiveUpdate[-2]	Almost from the beginning, LiveUpdate would not function.[norton]	updates[-2]	First, it failed whenever connecting to get updates.[norton]	LiveUpdate[-2]	When I finally got it working, it only worked properly for many a month.[norton]	components[-2]	The next problem was that it didn't recognize all the installed components, so it would not update them, most notably and importantly, virus definitions.[norton]	functions[+1]	Once installed, however, some of the functions do work OK (Disk Doctor, One Button Checkup, and WinDoctor).[norton]	faster[+1], menu[+2]	These tasks are faster and easier than in prior versions, and I found the menu to be much more navigable.[norton]	LiveUpdate[-2]	But this doesn't make up for it's innumerable other short-comings, the biggest of which is the inability to download any updates due to problems with LiveUpdate.[norton]	installs[-2]	The other annoyance with this that you have to remove every single remnant of previous version of Norton SystemWorks before you installs this.[norton]	removal program[-2]	Warning! The Windows "remove program" feature does not do a good job of this, and neither does Norton's own removal program.[norton]	fragments[-2]	A lot of "fragments" were left in the Registry, and it the Norton system folders.[norton]	remove[+1]	Their website had a download that helped remove those, although I had to manually remove a good number of files from the "Programs" directory.[norton]	install[-3]	If you have an older version of "Internet Security" installed, you may also need to remove it as well before proceeding with SystemWorks install.[norton]	remove[-2]	You also need to go in and MANUALLY remove many Symantec files from the REGISTRY.[norton]	products[-3]	As of October, 2004, these products are NOT working and I'm ready to demand a refund from Symantec.[norton]	functionality[-3]	I just uninstalled SystemWorks and Internet Security for at least the fifth time due to funtionality issues.[norton]	reinstall[-3]	Once again it won't reinstall, even with online and email assistance from Symantect Technicians.[norton]	version 2004[-3]	The best thing to do with this version, is to leave it on the store shelf. It doesn't work, and will cost you an enormous amount of your time, not to mention your hard earned dollars.[norton]	Symantect products[-3]	Personally, I may never buy Symantect products again.[norton]	product[-3]	Avoid this product at all costs.[norton]	2004 edition[-1]	There are some highs to the 2004 edition, but mostly lows.[norton]	program[-2], cost[-1]	The program brings more problems than a virus, albeit not as major problems, just not what you expect for 70 bucks.[norton]	support[-2]	I had a question about the pros and cons of turning off the Norton firewall vs. the windows firewall, and waited 45 minutes to speak with a tech support representative because I did not have a "customer priority ID number."[norton]	priority ID[-1]	Then when I went to Norton's website to obtain a priority ID number per the instructions I had been given, I couldn't find a way to get one.[norton]	support[-1]	So I e-mailed the online tech support with that simple question, and got a reply which was totally unresponsive (it looked as though they didn't actually read the e-mail and just sent back a few boilerplate paragraphs).[norton]	Norton[-3]	And, when you think about it, it's insulting that Norton requires its customers to jump through these hoops -- anyone who can provide proof of purchase, whether on the phone or online (what if your computer is down?), should have equal priority.[norton]	memory usage[+2]	Norton's memory usage on systems with 512 MB is very low.[norton]	memory usage[+2]	I just got an older 866 Mhz system with 512 PC 133 RAM and it also runs fine on that.[norton]	update[+1]	Both the antivirus and firewall are integrated into one piece of software and they update together.[norton]	update[+2]	You won't need to update your firewall and antivirus separately or install two disks.[norton]	visual backtracking[+3]	The best part of the firewall is the visual backtracking.[norton]	product[-3]	Stay away from this product![norton]	2004[-3]	I don't know what's happened to Norton, but 2004 is absolute garbage.[norton]	support[-3]	The customer support is pathetic.[norton]	Norton internet security[-2]	I have found too many bugs in Norton Internet Security Professional to recommend it to any one without extreme patience and experience.[norton]	product[-3]	This product is absolutely not ready for release.[norton]	slow[-3]	It is buggy, slow and basically frustrates the heck out of the user.[norton]	product[-3]	I am an IT professional and have used Norton for years, but this product is a complete and utter dud.[norton]	Internet Security[-2], antivirus[-2]	It's a rip off if one buys Norton Internet Security and antivirus.[norton]	internet security[-2], antivirus software[-2]	Nothing spectacular is done by internet security or by antivirus software.[norton]	parental controls[-2]	Even though I have the parental controls off it constantly starts updating them then freezes my computer.[norton]	firewall[-3]	Now in October,2004, the firewall said I couldn't OK anymore software to use the internet because its full.[norton]	capacity[-3], Support[-3]	Im at full capacity!!!! I called Symantic and they said they don't know why but I should get Tech's Support at $35/hr to help!! I did call them and was on hold for 55 minutes untill I hung up![norton]	product[-2], upgrade[-2]	So, DON'T buy this or upgrade.[norton]	2004 version[-2]	If you currently own the 2003 version, and are looking to upgrade to the 2004 version, don't.[norton]	activation process[-1], product[-2]	There is little meaningful difference between the two versions aside from the tedius activation process, and the product is currently rather buggy and has problems running unless cleanly installed on a formatted drive.[norton]	product[-2]	If you are new to the market and looking to buy a symantec software product, save yourself some money and buy the 2003 version.[norton]	Norton program[-3]	From day one, we've had hangups, crashes, glitches, continual reboots, LONG shutdowns due to "ccApp.exe" program running which is a Norton program.[norton]	Norton[-3]	Long reboots due to Norton taking FOREVER  to boot.[norton]	memory usage[-3]	We constantly got "Windows Virtual Memory Low" error messages popping up follwed by ridiculous slowdowns and/or crashes.[norton]	support[-2]	Norton online support does not even acknowledge this problem nor does the computer company that preloaded it on our new computer.[norton]	support[-3]	Norton support is completely pathetic.[norton]	HOME VERSION[-3]	DO NOT BUY ANY HOME VERSION OF NORTON ANYTHING.[norton]	Corporate Edition[+2]	We were able to obtain a Norton Corporate Edition of Antivirus only (no firewall or utilities) and so far it's great.[norton]	Corporate edition[+3]	 I've used the Corporate edition at work without any problems ever.[norton]	Corporate edition[+2], home version[-3][cs]	If we had been unable to obtain the Corporate edition, we would NOT have purchased another Norton 2004 or 2005 home version anything.[norton]	Norton Internet/AV 2004[-3]	Our Norton Internet/AV 2004 was terrible right from the get go, so I'd think that if SytemWorks is ok now, it should remain ok.[norton]	corporate[+3]	By the way, I use the Norton 2003 Corporate at work with absolutely no trouble.[norton]	professional version[+2]	Likewise, I've heard Norton 2004 PROFESSIONAL version is fine too.[norton]	home version[-2]	Just the home version of Norton Internet/AV has too many glitches and problems to even remotely bother with.[norton]	work[-3]	I am an advanced computer user, so I cannot even imagine how a new or novice user would ever get this terrible program to work![norton]	program scan[-1]	Seems the "program scan" feature did NOT find the EXE file for Outlook![norton]	support[-2][u]	Like most of their solutions (which first blame other applications for errors), the tech persons line was that this was probably a Microsoft error - it was NOT.[norton]	Symantec[-2]	It was a Symantec error.[norton]	update[-3]	After a recent update, I can no longer open more then 1 browser window.[norton]	support[-3]	I've searched the program and their online tech support (worthless) and have found no solutions.[norton]	[s]	Before installing anything on your computer, you need to do a bit of research before spending the money.[norton]	products[-1]	This is definitely one of those products, especially as the company is leaning more towards making a profit.[norton]	[s]	I recommended this for my father based on my experience with previous versions.[norton]	NIS 2004[+2]	I've been using NIS 2004 for about 2 months and it works well.[norton]	options[-1], intrusion[+2]	Some of the options are confusing, especially when the popup warnings occur, but I've had no problems with intrusions.[norton]	intrusion[+3]	Norton pops up a window about the intrusions and gives me as much detail as possible about where the intrusion is coming from.[norton]	popup blocker[+2], anti-spam[+2]	The popup blocker and anti-spam are bonuses.[norton]	Product[+1], instruction[-1]	Product is OK; however, despite the fact that I followed the rebate instructions explicitly, I am being denied the rebate because the processing agency incorrectly claims I did not send in proof of ownership of a previous product.[norton]	nstalling[+1]	I didn't have any major problems installing this software.[norton]	components[-1]	The only problem I had was a few components didn't quite load correctly upon startup, but a reboot fixed the problem.[norton]	working[+2]	Anyhow, this software is working fine and no problems since I installed it two weeks ago.[norton]	installation[-1]	I give it 4-stars only because the installation process - or rather problems that may surface during the installation process - can be frustrating to the average computer user.[norton]	installation[-1]	If you experience problems with installation, you can visit symantec's website, click the support tab, click the 'home or home office support' and there is an automated support assistant that can scan the Norton program files on your computer and it will tell you what is not working right and how to fix it.[norton]	installation[-1][u]	Can't get easier than that![norton]	spam[-2]	I already knew something was wrong, because much of the Spam I've seen in the past six months was from resellers of Norton products.[norton]	install[+2]	Mine installed no problem (but I DID uninstall my Norton Anti-Virus 2002 & Personal Firewall 2002 first).[norton]	work[+3]	Seems to work great.[norton]	NIS 04[-3]	I read many reviews on Norton I.S. 2004 from a variety of sources (Cnet, Amazon, message boards) and came to the conclusion that NIS 04 was a terrible product and not worth the update.[norton]	booting[-3]	Booting up my computer took forever!!![norton]	blocking[-3]	Then, my ad/pop-up blocking was completely gone.[norton]	blocking[-3]	My file log was not responding and the program was not blocking any cookies or unauthorized sites.[norton]	Tech Line[-2]	Again, every review written about the Tech Line is true...after waiting close to 45 minutes I finally spoke to a rep.[norton]	tech[-2]	After telling the rep and his tech supervisor the problem the only answer was to uninstall the program (which I had already done)...[norton]	tech[-3][p]	They didn't know what the problem could be.[norton]	support[-3][p]	I did it and it was worse the second time around...unbelievable.[norton]	Tech[-3]	Basically, I ate the cost of the renewal and ate the cost of the Tech Help.[norton]	unstalling[-1]	Unfortunately, it does not give you the option of unstalling (or uninstalling) them individually.[norton]	components[-1]	You can "disable" some of the individual components, but don't be fooled--they're still there and running.[norton]	Norton AntiSpam[-2]	Although I disabled Norton AntiSpam, it is still there.[norton]	product[+2]	This did manage to cut the number of popups during start-up from 4 down to 2.[norton]	popups[-2][u]	But those 2 come up every time.[norton]	Norton[-2], charge[-2]	Next, the big reason not to buy ANY Norton product:  If there's a problem with it, Norton charges $30 to even tell them about it.[norton]	charge[-2], Norton[-2][p]	Sure they say if it's their fault you won't get charged, but THEY are the ones who get to decide whether it's their fault.[norton]	NIS [+1]	While it didn't have all the features I would have liked, it was better than anything else I could find at the time.[norton]	installing[-2]	The problems I had installing Norton extended way beyond what Symantec should reasonably expect the public to deal with.[norton]	install[-3]	When I purchase software, I NEVER want to have to spend hours looking up solutions to my install problems -- in particular solutions that involve manually setting driver preferences or editing the registry![norton]	Spam killer[+2]	Also, with one click you can help train your spam killer.[norton]	wizard[+2]	And the firewall came with a wizard which made it effortless to configure it to my LAN.[norton]	download[-3]	I downloaded this set from Norton, and within minutes my Internet connection failed and my PC was almost dead due to registry problems from the download.[norton]	help[-3]	Their site offers no live help at all.[norton]	service[-3], support[-3]	I tried to call Norton, and the only numbers they list on their sites are either for Non-tech Customer Service (tried this one and hung up after 75 minute of MUZAC) or they have a $30 tech-support number.[norton]	cost[-3]	Who wants to pay $30 to discuss a defect in a product that just cost $95? (I also bought the back-up CD).[norton]	support[-2]	I finally got a free support number for Norton through my ISP support staff, but waited an hour or more for a voice.[norton]	refund[-3]	They said they would refund all the money, but a month later, they tell me now the back-up disc is not refundable as its cost is purely handling and shipping - $15 to "handle" and ship a CD? --and they have been indignant and combative on the phone and in emails.[norton]	product[-2], support[-3]	This is a terrible company with a bad product and awful support.[norton]	support[-3][cc]	After 10 years, I now downloaded McCaffee's product after calling their support....they answered quickly, and for free, and were very helpful.[norton]	Norton[-2]	No problems now, just a sickly disappointment in the way Norton has abandoned thier customers.[norton]	Norton[-3]	I see many other reviews that say the same....stay away from Norton, they don't deserve you, or anyone![norton]	firewall[+3], antivirus[+3], antispam[+2], Parental Control[+2]	It's a highly rated, KICK ASS firewall program that's bundled with the venerable Norton AntiVirus, plus extras (like Norton AntiSpam & Norton Parental Control) that make this security suite a must-have for people who have broadband internet access.[norton]	version 2004[-2]	I've alway liked Symantec products, except for this version 2004.[norton]	installing[-2]	If you are already using a previous version of nortron security and unistalled it to install the new version, you will still have all kind of problems in installing the new version on your system![norton]	product[+1]	Luckly,with 3 rebates this product will cost me nothing! it is indeed worth nothing.[norton]	install[-1], uninstall[-2]	To install that version you have to uninstall from the window registery anything called Symantec or Nortron,... also from the common files in the program folder the symantec folder has to be deleted.[norton]	installation[-2]	If you have no previous version of  nortron security on your system, or Nortron Antivirus, the installation will go fine, otherwise dig in and in to do a major registery clean up!the old programs will leave a trace that will mess up the new installation, even if you uninstalled the old programs perfectly.[norton]	support[-3]	What dissapointes me the most that a software like that  is not cheap gets zero support form symantec, if you want support, they'll charge you a Fee![norton]	zone alarm[+2],sygate[+2][cc]	I've tried the free versions of zone alarm and the free version of sygate and they both have a nice and easy installation and work great!.[norton]	symantec[-3]	I am giving a zero star to symantec for this version![norton]	help[+1]	The only free help you get is in renewing your subscription![norton]	Firewall[-1]	The only way my pc internet works is if I open the Firewall Program configuration and manually refresh it.[norton]	Symantec[-2]	Symantec should give us all a refund and apology![norton]	product[-3]	I will NEVER buy their product again at this rate, and neither should you.[norton]	product[+3]	The product has worked perfectly for me on my XP.[norton]	antivirus[+3]	No more banner ads, pop-ups, and the reliable antivirus.[norton]	antivirus[+3]	I work on word, explorer, netscape, acrobat reader, photoshop at same time (meaning using a lot of memory), but still dont see a problem with computer (getting slow or crashing).[norton]	product[+3][cc]	This product is way cooler than anything Ive used before (PcCillins and McCafees and Norton Antivirus alone).[norton]	product[+3][u]	5 stars all the way![norton]	Product [+1]	All in all it hasn't been a bad product.[norton]	Symantec[-2]	However, Symantec has taken a significant turn for the worse with this release.[norton]	firewall[+2], security suite[-2]	While it has a rather effective firewall, and comes with Norton Antivirus (which I'm actually rather fond of), the Security Suite has significantly slowed down my system.[norton]	boot[-2]	I'm currently using a Sony Vaio S-150 (which I bought at the end of this past August), and it takes about five minutes just to boot the system - in fact, I've taken to just hibernating, rather than shutting down completely.[norton]	antivirus[+2], internet security[-1](cs)	The Antivirus is good, but "Internet Security" just isn't worth it.[norton]	performance[+2]	I've owned many Norton products in my time, and for the most part, I've been pleased with their performance.[norton]	NIS 2004[+2]	This is also the case with NIS 2004.[norton]	upgrade[+2] performance[+1]	I upgraded from NIS 2003, and the change in performance has not been noticeable.[norton]	upgrade[+3]	On the contrary, I'm quite pleased with my upgrade.[norton]	performance[+3][u][cs], features[+3]	It works better and has more useful features than NIS 2003.[norton]	program[+2]	The program is fully featured, with much of what you'd want from a security program --[norton]	installation[+1], set-up[+1], operation interfaces[+1], email spam[+1]	The installation, set-up, and operating interfaces are well organized and intuitive and the email spam component works well.[norton]	symantec[-3]	HOWEVER, I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS PRODUCT AND WITH SYMANTEC.[norton]	performance[-2][u]	It feels like I'm back to the days of 56k dial-up internet service, even though I'm running a Dell 2GHz Pentium 4 with 256MB memory and have had excellent broadband service for the past year.[norton]	performance[-2][u]	I tried disabling the various components provided with this product, paring it all the way back to anti-virus only service... and saw no improvement.[norton]	symantec/Norton site[-2]	There is absolutely nothing useful at the Symantec/Norton site.[norton]	PRODUCT[-3]	However, I suspect that many people are having a bad experience -- DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT.[norton]	Uninstall[+3], Install[+3]	PIII 1Ghz 512MB RDRAM Windows XP Pro 80GB HD  I was able to Uninstall NIS 2003 and Install NIS 2004 with no trouble.[norton]	install[+2]	I installed, activated and registered NIS 2004 without issue.[norton]	Anti-Spam[+3]	So far, the Anti-Spam feature seems to be very good.[norton]	program[-2]	This program would not let me send Outlook Email or listen to Audible sample books online.[norton]	product[-3][u]	Buy this if you like mental challenges or trying how to pick locks.[norton]	processor[-3]	I had much of the same problems that everyone else has listed (mainly the SLOOOOOOOOOW processor), and then I couldn't get the damn thing off my computer completely![norton]	install[-1]	It locked during install and I had to reformat the drive and start from scratch (GRRRRRR!)[norton]	Computer Associates EZ[+1]	I downloaded a trial version of Computer Associates EZ Firewall and Antivirus and fell in love with a computer security system all over again.[norton]	Norton[-3]	And I can't warn you enough to STAY AWAY FROM NORTON!![norton]	installation[+2]	I did not have any of the installation problems that people highlighted here.[norton]	speed[-2][u]	It was immediately noticeable that NIS slows down my computer (Pent4, 256 RAM).[norton]	size[-2], scanning[-1]	I think it is a combination of the program size taking up resources and the open/close scanning that it does with every program.[norton]	scan[-1]	Is it necessary to scan my MS Money database when I close the program?[norton]	firewall[-3]	I have a modern PC with lots of speed and memory, but this firewall just brought it to a halt.[norton]	slow[-2][u]	Start up, log off, log on...everything became very slow.[norton]	home network[-2]	Configuring it for a home network was almost impossible.[norton]	network[-3]	Multiple users on one machine never seemed to behave like you'd expect.[norton]	alerts[-2]	While I was trying to play Half Life 2 it started popping up with "alerts" every twenty seconds (literally), warning me my antivirus protection was off.[norton]	alerts[-2]	But it wouldn't let me turn the AV protection back on and it wouldn't stop with the alerts.[norton]	uninstall[-2]	I had tried to uninstall Norton Internet Security a few weeks ago, and it wouldn't let me do that either.[norton]	Uninstall[-1][u]	I tried it again this morning and it said I didn't have the required "permissions" and lacked proper administrator status.[norton]	Symantec customer service[-3]	Of course, if you try to reach Symantec customer service you get useless automated systems unless you want to pay $30 per incident.[norton]	uninstallation[-1]	This time, it started the uninstallation process, then I left for work. I think it will work. I hope it will work.[norton]	Symantec[-3]	I simply hate Symantec. I swear, if I could have physically ripped that software out of my computer with my bare, bleeding hands, I would have.[norton]	products[+3]	Their products have been great and have saved my bacon on numerous occasions.
