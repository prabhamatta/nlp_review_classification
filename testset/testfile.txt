1	[t]excellent picture quality / color 
2	##i recently purchased the canon powershot g3 and am extremely satisfied with the purchase . 
3	use[+2]##the camera is very easy to use , in fact on a recent trip this past week i was asked to take a picture of a vacationing elderly group . 
4	##after i took their picture with their camera , they offered to take a picture of us . 
5	##i just told them , press halfway , wait for the box to turn green and press the rest of the way . 
6	##they fired away and the picture turned out quite nicely . ( as all of my pictures have thusfar ) . 
7	##a few of my work constituants owned the g2 and highly recommended the canon for picture quality . 
8	##i 'm easily enlarging pictures to 8 1/2 x 11 with no visable loss in picture quality and not even using the best possible setting as yet ( super fine ) . 
9	##ensure you get a larger flash , 128 or 256 , some are selling with the larger flash , 32mb will do in a pinch but you 'll quickly want a larger flash card as with any of the 4mp cameras .
